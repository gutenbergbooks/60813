<span class="cheaderfont">THRILLING VOYAGE IN A SEA-PLANE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was a muggy night in Dover&mdash;not an unusual
thing in Dover&mdash;but nevertheless the wind had an
extra whip in it and was lashing the outside Channel
into a state of wild waves. An acetylene flare revealed
several muffled figures flitting here and there
on the harbor brink. There was a glint from polished
surface, a flash-like, downward rush of a long,
tapering hull, and a splash in the dark waters below.
A sea-plane had been deftly launched. Motors
hummed, a wide wake streamed away to the rear of
the wonder craft, which, suddenly, as if by magic
drawn upward from the tide, joined the winds that
sported aloft.</p>

<p>Captain Leonidas Johnson, noted as an airman
in the four quarters of the globe, sat tight behind
the rudder wheel, and back in the band-box engine
room was Josiah Freeman, one time of Boston,
U. S. A.</p>

<p>Two aboard were not of the regular crew. Behind<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
the wind-screen were Billy Barry and Henri
Trouville, our Aviator Boys, bound for the coast of
France, and bound to get there.</p>

<p>Ever higher and higher, the intrepid navigators
sailed into a clearing atmosphere, where the clouds
were being gathered into a moonlight bath. The
120’s were forcing a speed of something like a mile
to the minute, and doing it at 2000 feet above the
sea level.</p>

<p>Through Dover Straits the swift trend of the
great mechanical bird was toward the North Sea,
the blurring high lights of Dover fading in the distance
rearward and Calais showing a glimmer on the
distant right.</p>

<p>Captain Johnson switched on the ghost light to
get his bearings from the facing dials, and speaking
to the shadowy figures in the observation seat indulged
in a bit of humor by asking:</p>

<p>“You young daredevils, how does this strike
you?”</p>

<p>An answering high note from Billy:</p>

<p>“You’re doing bully, Captain, but mind your eye
and don’t knock a hole in Dunkirk by flying too
low.”</p>

<p>“Well, of all the nerve,” chuckled the veteran
wheelman, “‘flying too low,’ and the sky almost
close enough to touch.”</p>

<p>A pressure forward on the elevating lever shot
the sea-plane downward, and the turn again to level<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
keel was made a scant five hundred feet above the
choppy surface of the Channel.</p>

<p>“We’ll take to boating again at Dunkirk,” observed
the captain, but the observation was heard
only by himself, for now the wind and the waves
and the motors and the straining of the aircraft
combined to drown even a voice like the captain’s.</p>

<p>There was destined to be no landing that night at
Dunkirk. An offshore gale, not to be denied, suddenly
swept the Channel with howling force. Rising,
dipping, twisting, the sea-plane dashed on in
uncertain course, and when at last it had outridden
the storm, Ostend was in sight&mdash;the Atlantic City
of the Belgians.</p>

<p>The stanch aircraft, with engines silenced,
rocked now upon the heaving tide. Its tanks were
empty. Not a drop of petrol in them. Retreat was
impossible, and in the broad light of the new day
there was no place of concealment.</p>

<p>While four shivering shapes shifted cramped positions
and gratefully welcomed the warming sun-rays,
they were under survey of powerful field-glasses
in the hands of a gray-garbed sentry.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_II" class="no-break">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A LOOK BACKWARD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>After following Billy and Henri in their perilous
and thrilling night ride, it has occurred that they
should have first been properly introduced and their
mission in the great war zone duly explained. Only
a few weeks preceding their first adventure, as described
in the <a href="#CHAPTER_I">initial chapter</a>, they were giving flying
exhibitions in Texas, U. S. A.</p>

<p>“That’s a pair for you!” proudly remarked Colonel
McCready to a little group of soldiers and civilians
intently looking skyward, marking the swift
and graceful approach through the sunlit air of a
wide-winged biplane, the very queen of the Flying
Squadron.</p>

<p>With whirring motor stilled, the great bird for a
moment hovered over the parade ground, then
glided to the earth, ran for a short distance along
the ground and stopped a few feet from the admiring
circle.</p>

<p>“That’s a pair for you!” repeated Colonel McCready,
as he reached for the shoulders of the youth
whose master hand had set the planes for the exquisitely
exact landing and gave a kindly nod to the
young companion of the pilot.</p>

<p>“I’ll wager,” continued the colonel delightedly,<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
“that it was a painless cutting of Texas air, this
flight; too fast to stick anywhere. Fifty-five miles
in sixty minutes, or better, I think, and just a
couple of kids&mdash;size them up, gentlemen&mdash;Mr. William
Thomas Barry and Mr. Henri Armond Trouville.”</p>

<p>Billy Barry adroitly climbed out of the little cockpit
behind the rudder wheel and patiently submitted
to the colonel’s hearty slaps on the back. Billy
never suffered from nerves&mdash;he never had any
nerves, only “nerve,” as his Uncle Jacob up in the
land where the spruce comes from used to say.
Billy’s uncle furnished the seasoned wood for aëroplane
building, and Billy’s brother Joe was boss of
the factory where the flyers are made. Billy knew
the business from the ground up, and down, too, it
might be added.</p>

<p>And let it be known that Henri Trouville is
also a boy of some parts in the game of flying. He
loved mechanics, trained right in the shops, and
even aspired to radiotelegraphy, map making aloft,
and other fine arts of the flying profession. Henri
has nerves and also nerve. He weighs fifty pounds
less than Billy, but could put the latter to his best
scuffle in a wrestling match. Both of them hustled
every waking minute&mdash;the only difference being
that pay days meant more to Billy than they did
to Henri.</p>

<p>No brothers were ever more firmly knit than they&mdash;this<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
hardy knot of spruce from Maine, U. S. A.,
and this good young sprout from the lilies of
France.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There’s a pair for you!</p>

<p>“Say, Colonel,” said Billy, with a fine attempt at
salute, “if I didn’t know the timber in those paddles
I wouldn’t have felt so gay when we hit the
cross-currents back yonder. I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” laughed the colonel, “you are always
ready to offer a trade argument when I want to
show you off. Now you come out of your shell,
Henri, and tell us what you think of the new engine.”</p>

<p>“There is sure some high power in that make,
sir,” replied Henri. “Never stops, either, until you
make it.”</p>

<p>“All you boys need,” broke in Major Packard, “is
a polishing bit of instruction in military reconnaissance,
and you would be a handy aid for the service.”</p>

<p>“While I am only factory broke, Major,” modestly
asserted Billy, “Henri there can draw a pretty
good map on the wing, if that counts for anything,
and do the radio reporting as good as the next.
What a fellow he is, too, with an engine; he can
tell by the cough in three seconds just where the
trouble is. If I was going into the scout business,<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
believe me, I might be able to make a hit by dropping
information slips through the card chute.”</p>

<p>The dark-eyed, slender Henri shook a finger at
his talkative comrade.</p>

<p>“Spare me, old boy, if you please,” he pleaded.
“Gentlemen,” turning to the others, who were
watching the housing of the aëroplane, “this bluffer
wouldn’t even speak to me when the altitude meter,
a little while ago, registered 3,000 feet. Then he
had a wheel in his hands; down here he has it in his
head!”</p>

<p>“Bully for you, comrade,” cried Billy. “I
couldn’t have come back that neatly if I tried. But
then, you know, I have to work to live, and you
only live to work.”</p>

<p>With this happy exchange the boys moved double
quick in the direction of quarters and the mess table.</p>

<p>Colonel McCready, with the others proceeding to
leisurely follow the eager food seekers, in his own
peculiar style went on to say:</p>

<p>“There’s a couple of youngsters who have been
riding a buckboard through some fifty miles of
space, several thousand feet from nowhere, at a
clip that would razzle-dazzle an eagle, and, by my
soul, they act like they had just returned from a
croquet tournament!”</p>

<p>Our Aviator Boys had grown fearless as air
riders. They had learned just what to do in cases
of emergency, in fact were trained to the hour in<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
cross-country flying. Rare opportunity, however,
was soon to present itself to give them a supreme
test of courage and skill.</p>

<p>Little they reckoned, this June evening down by
the Alamo, what the near future held in store for
them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />


<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">FAREWELL TO THE FACTORY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>An archduke had been killed on Servian soil, and
war had raised its dreadful shadow over stricken
Liège. The gray legions of the Kaiser were worrying
the throat of France. From the far-off valley
of the Meuse came a call of distress for Henri
Trouville.</p>

<p>Billy Barry was very busy that day with the work
of constructing hollow wooden beams and struts,
and had just completed an inspection of a brand-new
monoplane which the factory had sold to a rich
young fellow who had taken a fancy to the flying
sport. Coming out of the factory, he met his chum
and flying partner. Henri did not wear his usual
smile. With downcast head and his hands clasped
behind him he was a picture of gloom.</p>

<p>“Hello, Henri, what’s hurting you?” was Billy’s
anxious question.</p>

<p>“Billy boy,” Henri sadly replied, “it’s good night<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
to you and the factory for me. I’m going home.”</p>

<p>“Say, Buddy,” cried Billy, holding up his arm as
though to ward off a shock, “where did you get
your fever? Must have been overwarm in your
shop to-day.”</p>

<p>“It’s straight goods,” persisted Henri. “The
world has fallen down on Trouville and I’ve got to
go back and find what is under it.”</p>

<p>Billy with a sob in his voice: “Old pal, if it’s
you&mdash;then it’s you and me for it. I don’t care
whether it’s mahogany, ash, spruce, lance-wood,
black walnut or hickory in the frame, we’ll ride it
together.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy!” tearfully argued Henri; “it’s a flame
into which you’d jump&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;it wouldn’t do
at all. So, be a good fellow and say good-by right
here and get it over.”</p>

<p>“You can’t shake me.” Billy was very positive
in this. “We made ’em look up at Atlantic City.
We can just as well cause an eye-strain at Ostend
or any other old point over the water. The long
way to Tipperary or the near watch on the Rhine&mdash;it’s
all one to me. I’m going, going with you,
Buddy. Here’s a hand on it!”</p>

<p>The boys passed together through the factory
gate, looking neither to the right nor to the left,
nor backward&mdash;on their way to great endeavor and
to perils they knew not of.</p>

<p>Out to sea in a mighty Cunarder, the “flying<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
kids,” as everybody aboard called them, chiefly interested
themselves in the ship’s collection of maps.
As they did not intend to become soldiers they were
too shrewd to go hunting ’round war zone cities
asking questions as to how to get to this place or
that. They had no desire to be taken for spies.</p>

<p>“Right here, Billy,” said Henri, indicating with
pencil point, “is where we would be to-night if I
could borrow the wings of a gull.”</p>

<p>Billy, leaning over the map, remarked that a
crow’s wings would suit him better, adding:</p>

<p>“For we would certainly have to do some tall
dodging in that part of the country just now.”</p>

<p>“Do you know,” questioned Henri earnestly,
“that I haven’t told you yet of the big driving reason
for this dangerous journey?”</p>

<p>“Well,” admitted Billy, “you didn’t exactly furnish
a diagram, but that didn’t make much difference.
The main point to me was that you tried to
say good-by to your twin.”</p>

<p>“Billy,” continued Henri, drawing closer, and in
voice only reaching the ear at his lips, “behind a
panel in the Château Trouville are gold and jewels
to the value of over a million francs. It is all that
remains of a once far greater fortune. My mother,
when all hope of turning back the invading armies
had gone, fled to Paris in such haste that she took
with her little more of worth than the rings on her
hands. She may be in want even now&mdash;and she<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
never wanted before in her life. I am her free man&mdash;my
brothers are in the trenches with the Allies
somewhere, I don’t know where. It’s up to me to
save her fortune and pour it into her lap.”</p>

<p>“It’s the finest thing I know,” said Billy. “Show
me the panel!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Planning their first movement abroad, the boys
that night decided to make for Dover after landing.
It was a most convenient point from which to
proceed to the French coast, and there they expected
to find two tried and true friends, airmen,
too, Captain Leonidas Johnson and Josiah Freeman,
formerly employed as experts in the factory
at home, and both of whom owed much to Billy’s
uncle in the way of personal as well as business
favors.</p>

<p>What happened at Dover has already been told,
and now to return to them, stranded in the water off
the Belgian coast.</p>

<p>For hours Billy had been stationed as lookout on
the stranded hydroplane. He was taking cat-naps,
for it had been quite a while since he last enjoyed
a bed. While an expected round-shot from the<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
shore did not come to disturb the tired airmen,
something else happened just about as startling. In
a waking moment Billy happened to look up, and
there he saw a great dirigible circling above the
harbor. The boy’s eyes were wide open now.</p>

<p>“Henri,” he loudly whispered, prodding his sleeping
chum with a ready foot. “Look alive, boy!
They’re coming after us from the top side!”</p>

<p>Henri, alive in a jiffy, passed a friendly kick to
Captain Johnson, and he in turn bestowed a rib jab
upon Freeman. Then all eyes were glued on the
hovering Zeppelin.</p>

<p>A mile seaward, from the armored side of a gunboat,
burst a red flash wreathed by smoke; then a
dull boom. The Zeppelin majestically swerved to
southwest course, all the time signaling to masked
batteries along the shore.</p>

<p>“There is bigger game around here than us,”
said Captain Johnson. “If only those tanks were
chockfull of petrol again we’d show them all a clean
pair of heels.”</p>

<p>“If we don’t move somehow and soon,” gloomily
put in Freeman, “we’ll be dead wood between two
fires.”</p>

<p>The Zeppelin was now pushing skyward, buzzing
like a million bees. Just then a Taube aëroplane,
armored, swooped toward the gunboat, evidently
British, which had endeavored to pot the Zeppelin.
The scout-ship below turned its anti-aircraft cannon<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
and rifles against the latest invader, cutting its
wings so close that the Taube hunted a higher and
safer level. The Zeppelin had again lowered its
huge hulk for the evident purpose of dropping on
the gunboat some of the bombs stored in its special
armored compartment.</p>

<p>Another sputtering jet of flame from the gunboat
and one of the forward propellers of the airship
collapsed and a second shot planted a gash in her
side. Sagging and wabbling, the dirigible headed
for the Belgian coast. When the black mass loomed
directly above the stranded sea-plane, <a id="Ref_15"></a>Freeman gave
a warning shout:</p>

<p>“Down with you! She’s trailing her anchor!”</p>

<p>By quick thought, in that thrilling, fleeting moment,
Billy grabbed the swinging anchor as it was
dragged along near to him and deftly hooked one of
its prongs under the gun carriage at the sea-plane’s
bow.</p>

<p>With jerks that made every strut and wire
crackle under the strain, the hydroplane, on its polished
floats, skipped over the waves, pulled this
way and that, now with elevated nose, now half
under water, but holding firmly to the trailing cable.</p>

<p>Henri, with head over the wind-screen, keenly
watched the shore for a likely landing-place. The
men in the cars of the disabled Zeppelin did not
seem to notice the extra weight on the anchor&mdash;they<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
had troubles of their own in getting the damaged
dirigible to safe landing.</p>

<p>Billy crouched in the bow-seat, his eyes fixed on
the straining cable. In his right hand he clutched
a keen-edged hatchet, passed forward by Freeman.
Half drowned by the spray tossed in his face he
awaited the word from Henri.</p>

<p>“Say when, old pard,” he cried, slightly turning
his head.</p>

<p>“If she pulls straight up and down,” remarked
Captain Johnson in Freeman’s ear, “it’s good
night.”</p>

<p>The coast line seemed rushing toward the incoming
sea-plane, bouncing about in the wide wash.</p>

<p>Henri sighted a friendly looking cove, and excitedly
sang out the word for which his chum was
waiting:</p>

<p>“Now!”</p>

<p>With the signal Billy laid the hatchet with sounding
blows upon the cable&mdash;and none too soon the
tough strands parted.</p>

<p>The sea-plane with the final snap of the hacked
cable dashed into the drift and plowed half its
length in the sandy soil. The Zeppelin bobbed away
into the gathering dusk.</p>

<p>Following the bump, Captain Johnson set the first
foot on the sand. Stretching himself, he fixed a
glance of concern on the sea-plane.</p>

<p>“I wonder if there is a joint in that craft that<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
isn’t loose?” he questioned. “But,” he added, with
a note of sorrow, “it’s not likely she will ever see
her station again, and so what’s the difference?”</p>

<p>“It was some voyage, though,” suggested Freeman
in the way of comfort.</p>

<p>“It was bully,” maintained Billy. “If we had
traveled any other way, Henri there would no doubt
by this time have been wearing red trousers and
serving the big guns around Paris, and I might
have been starving while trying to get change for
a ten-dollar bill in that big town.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you will like it better,” asked Freeman,
“to stand up before a firing squad with a handkerchief
tied ’round your eyes?”</p>

<p>“I should worry,” laughed Billy.</p>

<p>“There’s no scare in you, boy,” said Captain
Johnson, giving Billy an affectionate tap on the
back. “Now,” he continued seriously, “it’s hard to
tell just what sort of reception we are going to get
hereabouts. Old Zip and I” (turning to Freeman)
“certainly made the people on the paved ‘boardwalk’
stare with some of our flying stunts. But
that was last year.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me,” broke in Billy, “that I have
given the high ride to several of the big ‘noises’ on
all sides of the war, and they one and all promised
me the glad hand if I ever came to see them.”</p>

<p>“That, too,” said Freeman, with a grin, “was a
year or more ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<p>“Speaking of time,” put in Henri, “it also seems
to me a matter of a year or two since I had anything
to eat. I’m as hungry as a wolf.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you on the eat proposition,” Billy
promptly cast his vote. “Where’s the turkey hid,
Captain?”</p>

<p>“It’s a lot of turkey you’ll get this night,” grimly
replied the captain. “There’s a little snack of sandwiches
in the hold, cold roast, I believe, but that’s
all. We didn’t equip for a sail like this.”</p>

<p>Billy and Henri lost no time rummaging for the
sandwiches, and while the meat and bread were being
consumed to the last crumb by the hungry four,
Billy furnished an idea in place of dessert:</p>

<p>“We don’t want to lose ten thousand dollars’
worth of flying machine on this barren shore.
Henri and I are going to do a bit of scouting while
the soldier crowd are busy among themselves up
the coast. If there is any petrol to be had we are
going to have it.”</p>

<p>Fitting action to the words, the two boys moved
with stealthy tread, Indian fashion, toward the
ridge that shadowed and concealed the temporary
camp of the airmen. Captain Johnson did not
wholly approve of this venture on the part of the
boys, but they did not give him time to argue
against it, and were soon beyond recall.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">RAN AWAY WITH AN AUTOMOBILE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Night had come and in front of one of the handsome
hotels that had escaped splintering when Ostend,
the famous seaside resort, under fire of big
guns, was swept by shot and shell, Gun-Lieutenant
Mertz had just stepped out of a big gray automobile
that looked like a high speeder&mdash;the kind that has
plenty of power. The driver of the car did not wait
for a second order to leave the lieutenant and speed
away in the direction of the mess quarters, where
he knew that there was a fragrant stew being prepared
for duty men coming in late.</p>

<p>The fighting of the day had mostly taken place
far up the coast, and the chance had arrived for a
loosening of belts in Ostend.</p>

<p>With a final chug the big gray car came to a
standstill in a quiet corner off the main street, while
the hungry chauffeur joined his comrades in what
they called pot-luck. The movements of this man
had been watched with a large amount of interest
by a pair of visitors, who had chosen the darkest
places they could find while approaching the dining
hall of the soldiers.</p>

<p>“Gee!” whispered one of the watchers to the
other. “I can almost feel a bullet in my back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[20]</span></p>

<p>From the companion shadow: “Take your foot
out of my face, can’t you?”</p>

<p>Two heads uplifted at the sight of the rear lights
of the car.</p>

<p>Again an excited whisper:</p>

<p>“Now for it, Billy!”</p>

<p>The soldiers were laughing and talking loudly in
the dining hall.</p>

<p>The boys crawled along, carefully avoiding the
light that streamed from the windows of the hall.
A moment later they nimbly climbed into the car.
Henri took the wheel and gently eased the big machine
away into the shadowy background. Then he
stopped the car and intently listened for any sound
of alarm. The soldiers were singing some war song
in the dining hall, keeping time with knives and
forks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a good time for the boys to make a start
in earnest, and they started with no intention of
stopping this side of the ridge, behind which their
friends were anxiously watching and waiting for
them.</p>

<p>Henri drove cautiously until he felt sure that
they were out of the principal avenues of travel,
and then he made things hum. He guided straight
toward a clump of trees showing black against the
moon just appearing above the crest of the hill.
The riding grew rough, but the speed never slackened.<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
At last the goal was reached. The car
bumped and bounced up, and bounced and bumped
down the hill.</p>

<p>Leaping from the machine, Billy fairly rolled to
the feet of the startled crew of the sea-plane.</p>

<p>“So help me,” exclaimed Captain Johnson, “if
I didn’t think it was a section of the Fourth Corps
after our scalps!”</p>

<p>“Hurry!” gasped Billy. “Get anything that will
hold oil, and get it quick!”</p>

<p>For the moment confused, Johnson and Freeman
seemed tied fast to the ground.</p>

<p>Henri rolled into the circle and added his gasp:</p>

<p>“We’ve a touring car up there and its tanks are
loaded!”</p>

<p>Then the boss mechanic, Freeman, came to the
front. From the depths of the engine room in the
motor end of the sea-plane he pulled a heavy coil
of rubber tubing and in a few minutes made attachments
that tapped the automobile’s plentiful supply
of petrol and sent it gurgling into the empty tanks
of the sea-plane.</p>

<p>Across the sandy plain came the sound, faintly,
of shouting. Maybe somebody had discovered that
the officer’s car was missing.</p>

<p>As Billy suggested with a laugh:</p>

<p>“Perhaps they think some joy riders took it.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to stay to find out what they<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
think,” very promptly asserted Captain Johnson.
“Heave her out, boys!”</p>

<p>The sea-plane took the water like a duck. Obedient
to Johnson’s touch it leaped upward, the motors
were humming, and with a cheery cackle Freeman
announced:</p>

<p>“We’re off again.”</p>

<p>“And they are showing us the way,” cried Billy,
as a great searchlight inland sent a silver shaft directly
overhead.</p>

<p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Riflemen on the ridge were
popping at the sea-plane.</p>

<p>“There’s a salute for good measure,” observed
Henri.</p>

<p>“Lucky we’re out of range of those snipers, but
I’m thinking the batteries might attempt to take a
whack at us.”</p>

<p>With these words Captain Johnson set the planes
for another jump skyward.</p>

<p>“There’s the good old moon to bluff the searchlight,”
sang out Billy from the lookout seat. “And,
see, there’s a row of smokestacks sticking out of
the water. Sheer off, Captain; don’t let those cruisers
pump a shot at us. They’d wreck this flyer in
a minute!”</p>

<p>The sea-plane was taking the back-track at fine
speed when valve trouble developed in the engine
room. The cylinders were missing fire, and all of
Freeman’s expert tinkering failed to prevent the<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
necessity of rapid descent. The hum of the motors
died away, and Captain Johnson dived the craft
seaward with almost vertical plunge. The sea-plane
hit the water with a dipping movement that raised
a fountain over the lookout, and it was Billy that
cried “Ugh!” when he was drenched from head to
foot by the downfall of several gallons of cold water.</p>

<p>The aircraft had alighted only a few rods from
land, in a shallow, marshy bay. The place was as
silent as the grave, save for the calling of the night
birds and the gentle lapping of the waves. Freeman
with the aid of an extra propeller fitting, paddled
the craft into shore, and was soon busy trying
to find out what was the matter with the machinery.
Captain Johnson held the acetylene flare over
Freeman’s shoulder to enable the engineer to see
where repair was needed.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri, out of a job for the time being,
concluded that they would do some exploring.
After wading through the mud, weeds and matted
grass for a hundred yards or so they reached firm
footing on higher ground.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI" class="no-break">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">DEATH RIDE OF AN AVIATOR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The moon was shining brightly, and over the
plain that stretched out before them on the left
the boys could see quite a distance, but no sign of
human life presented itself. On the right, however,
a half mile away, was a sharp rise of ground and
tall trees. Toward this point they decided to proceed.
Then it was that they first realized the experience
of standing on a battlefield.</p>

<p>Crossing the field they saw the ravages of artillery
projectiles&mdash;deep, conical holes, five or six feet
in diameter. Here, too, they found shrapnel cases,
splinters of shells, skeletons of horses, fragments of
bloodstained clothing and cartridge pouches. The
moonlight made the path as open as day, and each
object reminding of terrible conflict was apparently
magnified by the white shine of the moon. The
boys walked as in a dream, and were first awakened
by the flapping wings of a huge bird, frightened
by their approach from its perch on a broken gun-carriage.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of this,” mumbled Henri; “it gives
me shivery shakes; it’s a graveyard, and it seems
like ghosts of dead soldiers are tracking us.”</p>

<p>Billy was short on nerves, but if he had been<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
called on for a confession just then he might have
pleaded guilty to a tremble or two.</p>

<p>He managed to put on a bold front, however, and
was about to give Henri a brace by telling him they
would have to get used to the ways of war, when
there was a sound like the roll of distant thunder far
to the south.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>Billy’s sudden question drove the ghosts away
from Henri’s mind, and both boys ran like deer
up the hill to the line of trees.</p>

<p>“There’s no storm over there,” panted Henri.
“You can’t see a cloud as big as a man’s hand.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t thunder!” exclaimed Billy. “That’s
cannon! They’re shooting at something!”</p>

<p>“There,” cried Henri, “that sounds like fire-crackers
now.”</p>

<p>“Rifles,” observed Billy.</p>

<p>“Look!” Billy was pointing to what appeared,
at the distance, to be a speck on the face of the
moon.</p>

<p>The sound of gunfire increased, report after report&mdash;crack,
crack, boom, boom, boom.</p>

<p>Across and far above the moonlit plain, arrow-like,
sped a winged shadow, growing in size as it
swiftly approached.</p>

<p>“An aëroplane!” The boys well knew that kind
of a bird. They called its name in one voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p>

<p>“That’s what has been drawing the fire of those
guns.”</p>

<p>Billy had found the problem easy to solve when
he noted the getaway tactics of the coming airman.</p>

<p>The boys could now hear the whirring of the
motor. Fifty yards away the aëroplane began to
descend. Gracefully it volplaned to the earth under
perfect control. It landed safely, rolled a little
way, and stopped.</p>

<p>The boys, without a second thought, raced down
the slope to greet the aviator, like one of their own
kind should be greeted, but as quickly halted as they
drew nearer.</p>

<p>The airman was dead.</p>

<p>He had been fatally wounded at the very start of
his last flight, but just before death, at its finish,
had set his planes for a descent. With his dead
hands gripping the controllers, the craft had sailed
to the earth. He wore the yellowish, dirt-colored
khaki uniform of a British soldier.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri removed their caps in reverence
to valor and to honor the memory of a gallant comrade
who had been game to the last.</p>

<p>Releasing the dead aviator from his death grip
on the controllers, the boys tenderly lifted the
corpse from the driver’s seat in the machine and
covered the upturned face and glazed eyes with the
muffler the airman had worn about his neck. The<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
body was that of a youth of slight build, but well
muscled. In the pockets of his blouse the boys
found a pencil, a memorandum book and a photograph,
reduced to small size by cutting round the
face&mdash;a motherly type, dear to all hearts.</p>

<p>The usual mark of identity of soldiers in the
field was missing, but on the third finger of the
left hand was a magnificent seal ring, on which was
engraved an eagle holding a scroll in its beak and
clutching a sheaf of arrows in its talons.</p>

<p>Billy took possession of these effects with silent
determination to some day deliver them to the pictured
mother, if she could be found.</p>

<p>“The ring shows that he came of a noble house,”
said Henri, who had some knowledge of heraldry.</p>

<p>“He was a brave lad, for all that, and noble in
himself,” remarked Billy, who had the American
idea that every man is measured by his own pattern.</p>

<p>So they gave the dead youth the best burial they
could, at the foot of one of the giant trees, and
sadly turned away to inspect the aëroplane that
had been so strangely guided.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful machine, all the fine points
visible to their practiced eyes&mdash;a full-rigged military
biplane, armor plates and all. The tanks of extra
capacity were nearly full of petrol.</p>

<p>“It must have been a short journey, as well as a
fatal one,” said Billy. “Very likely the launching<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
was from a British ship, not far out at sea, and
the purpose was to make a lookover of the German
land forces around here.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to take a little jaunt in that machine,”
sighed Henri, who could not tear himself away from
the superb flyer.</p>

<p>“It may turn out that you will&mdash;stranger things
have happened.”</p>

<p>Billy proved to be a prophet, but it was not a
“little jaunt,” but a long ride that the boys took in
that aëroplane.</p>

<p>An unpleasant surprise was in immediate store
for them.</p>

<p>They decided that it was about time that they
should return to their friends and the sea-plane, and
were full of and eager to tell Johnson and Freeman
of the results of their scouting.</p>

<p>“Guess the captain won’t wonder at anything we
do since we brought that automobile into camp,”
declared Billy. “You know he said that he hadn’t
any breath to save for our next harum-scarum performance.”</p>

<p>“I can just see Freeman grin when I tell him
that we have found a flying-machine that can beat
his sea-sailer a mile. That’s my part of the story,
you know,” added Henri.</p>

<p>“I can’t help thinking of the poor fellow who
rode her last,” was Billy’s sober response.</p>

<p>The boys were nearing the point where the heavy<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
walking began. Otherwise they would have broken
into a run, so eager were they to tell about their
adventures.</p>

<p>Coming out of the weeds and ooze, they stood
looking blankly at the spot where the sea-plane
had rested.</p>

<p>The sea-plane and their friends were gone!</p>



<hr class="chap" />


<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII" class="no-break">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ALONE ON A STRANGE COAST.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When the boys made the startling discovery that
the sea-plane had disappeared and that they were
alone on the strange coast, they plumped down on
the sand without a single idea in the world except
that they were utterly tired out and weak from
hunger.</p>

<p>They could not account in any way for the mysterious
happening that had deprived them of their
tried and true friends.</p>

<p>Not for a moment did they imagine that they
had been deserted by intent. They knew full well
that even in the face of great danger Captain Johnson
and Josiah Freeman were not the kind of men
who would fly away, without sign or signal, and
leave a comrade in distress, let alone these boys
for whom either of the men would have spilled
his last drop of blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[30]</span></p>

<p>“The coast patrol nabbed them,” was the opinion
of Billy.</p>

<p>“They were held up at the point of a bayonet,
I’ll bet,” argued Henri, “for there is no sign of a
struggle, and we would have heard it if there had
been any shooting.”</p>

<p>“However it was,” figured Billy, “they never
quit of their own accord; they would never have
left us unless they had been hauled away by force.
Now it is up to us to skirmish for ourselves, which,
anyhow, I expected to do sooner or later. There’s
no use staying here, for they will be coming after
us next.”</p>

<p>Wearily the boys plodded through the slush, backtracking
to the foot of the hill where they had left
the aëroplane. The fading moon was lost behind
a wall of slowly rising mist, and the dawn was
breaking in the east when the boys finally stumbled
upon the place that held their prize. Wholly exhausted,
they threw themselves full length upon the
ground and slept like logs.</p>

<p>The sun was broadly shining when Billy reached
out a lazy arm to poke his chum, who was snuggled
up in the grass and breathing like a porpoise.</p>

<p>“Get up and hear the birds sing,” yawned Billy.</p>

<p>“I’d a good sight rather hear a kettle or a coffee-pot
sing,” yawned Henri.</p>

<p>“Right O,” agreed Billy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[31]</span></p>

<p>The boys rolled over alongside of the aëroplane.
A twin thought came to them that the late aviator
surely must have carried something to eat with
him.</p>

<p>It proved a glorious truth. There was a knapsack
behind the driver’s seat and a canteen swinging
under the upper plane.</p>

<p>“A meat pie!” Billy made the first find.</p>

<p>“Crackers and cheese!” Heard from Henri.</p>

<p>How good these rations tasted&mdash;even the lukewarm
water in the canteen was like nectar. With
new life the boys took up the problem presented
by the next move.</p>

<p>Henri climbed into the aëroplane and very carefully
inspected the delicate machinery, making free
use of the oil can. Billy otherwise attended to the
tuning of the craft, and everything was as right as
a trivet in less than a half hour.</p>

<p>“Let me see”&mdash;Billy was thumbing a well-worn
notebook&mdash;“as we fixed it on the steamer, Dunkirk
was the starting place. But that storm entirely
changed the route&mdash;a longer way round, I guess.
No more Ostend for me, though I do wish I knew
for sure whether or not they had Captain Johnson
and Freeman locked up there. Let’s try for Bruges;
that’s only a short distance from here, and we can
follow the line of the canal so we won’t get lost.”</p>

<p>“And we can fly high,” suggested Henri, “high
enough to keep from getting plugged.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[32]</span></p>

<p>“I am not bothering so much about the ‘high’
part of it as I am about where we’ll land,” said
Billy. “We may fall into a hornet’s nest.”</p>

<p>“Let’s make it Bruges, for luck,” suggested
Henri.</p>

<p>“Here goes, then,” exclaimed Billy, getting into
steering position, Henri playing passenger.</p>

<p>Off they skimmed on the second stage of their
journey to the valley of the Meuse, in France.</p>

<p>They had entered the zone where five nations
were at each other’s throats.</p>

<p>So swift was their travel that our Aviator Boys
very soon looked down upon the famous old belfry
of Bruges, the old gabled houses, with bright red
tiled roofs, mirrored in the broad canal crossed by
many stone bridges. That is what Bruges means,
“bridges.” To the young airmen, what the town
meant just now was a good dinner, if they did
not have to trade their lives or their liberty for a
chance to get it.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing here,” lamented Henri, who did
the looking down while Billy looked ahead. “I see
that there are too many gray-coats visiting in West
Flanders. And I heard that the Belgians have not
been giving ‘days at home’ since the army came.
Now I see that it is true.”</p>

<p>“Having fun with yourself?” queried Billy, in
the sharp tone necessary to make himself heard in
a buzzing aircraft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[33]</span></p>

<p>Henri ignored the question, snapping: “The
book says it’s thirty-five miles from here to Ypres,
straight; keep your eyes on the waterways, and you
can’t miss it.”</p>

<p>“Another thing the book says,” snapped Billy, in
response, “is that that old town is in a district as
flat as a floor, and, if nothing else, we are sure of a
landing.”</p>

<p>“I wish we were as sure of a dinner.” Henri
never lost sight of the dinner question.</p>

<p>The flight was continued in silence. It was a
strain to keep up conversation, and the boys quit
talking to rest their throats. Besides, there was
not a drop of water left in the canteen.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon when the boys saw Ypres
beneath them. It was just about the time that the
Allies were advancing in the region between Ypres
and Roulers, the town where the best Flemish lace
comes from. But the Allies had not yet reached
Ypres.</p>

<p>Henri glimpsed the remains of some ancient fortifications,
and urged Billy to make a landing right
there.</p>

<p>“A good place to hide in case of emergency,” he
advised.</p>

<p>Billy agreed, set the planes for a drop, and came
down neatly in the open.</p>

<p>“We ought to be able to get a change of linen
here, for that’s the big business in this town.” Henri<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
was pretty well posted, for in his cradle he had
slept on Ypres linen.</p>

<p>There was no work going on in the fertile fields
around the town. The Belgian peasants thereabouts
were either under arms or under cover.</p>

<p>“When King Louis set up these old ramparts he
probably did not look forward to the day when they
would provide a hangar for a flying-machine.” This
from Billy, who was pushing the aëroplane to the
shelter of a crumbling fortalice.</p>

<p>“If we had dropped in on the fourteenth century,
as we did to-day,” observed Henri, “I’ll warrant
that we would have scared everybody out of Flanders.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t appear, as it is, that there is a person
around here bold enough to approach us.”</p>

<p>Billy seemed surprised that they had not run
into trouble at the very start.</p>

<p>“‘Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles
you,’” quoted Henri. “It goes something like that,
I think.”</p>

<p>“Listen!” Billy raised a hand to warn Henri not
to move nor speak aloud. The sound that had put
Billy on the alert was a long, low whistle. It was
repeated, now and again. Curious, and also impressed
that the whistler was trying to attract their
attention, they began a search among the ruins.
Over the top of a huge slab of stone suddenly
popped a red cap, covering a regular Tom Thumb<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
among Belgians&mdash;about four feet from tow head to
short boots.</p>

<p>Henri said “Howdy” to him in French, at the
same time extending a friendly hand. The youngster,
evidently about fifteen, shyly gave Henri two
fingers in greeting. He bobbed his head to Billy.
Then he removed his red cap and took out of it a
soiled and crumpled slip of paper. On the slip, apparently
torn from a notebook, was scribbled:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This boy saw you fly in, told us how you
looked, and, if it is you, this will let you know
that the Germans brought us here for safe-keeping
yesterday. <span class="smcap" style="padding-left:1em">Cap.</span>”</p></div>

<p>“Glory be!” Billy could hardly contain himself,
and the little Belgian took his first lesson in tangoing
from an American instructor. “As soon as
it is dark we will move on the outer works,” was
his joyous declaration.</p>

<p>“Say, my young friend,” he added, “do you know
where we can get a bite to eat while we’re waiting?”
Henri translated, and the little Belgian was off like
a shot. About dusk he returned with some bread
and bologna, looped up in a fancy colored handkerchief.
And there was plenty of water in the
Yperlee river.</p>

<p>Along about 11 o’clock that night Leon, the little
Belgian, whispered, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Venez</i>” (Come).</p>

<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII" class="no-break">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ONE DARK NIGHT IN YPRES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The sky had turned dark over Ypres, rain had
commenced to fall in streets so remarkably clean
that they really did not need this bath from above.
It was just the kind of a night, though, for the risky
venture undertaken by our Aviator Boys. They
were going to see their old friends, and nothing
but a broken leg would check their willing steps on
the way to the prison house that contained Captain
Johnson and Josiah Freeman.</p>

<p>Leon knew the best way to get there. The darkest
ways were light to him, and he was not afraid
that rain would spoil his clothes. To guide these
wonderful flying boys was the happiest thing that
had happened to him in all his days, and, too, he
had a strong dislike for the Germans who had invaded
the homeland. His father was even now
fighting in the ranks of the Allies at Nieuport, and
his mother was wearing her heart out in the fields
as the only breadwinner for her little brood.</p>

<p>There were comparatively few of the gray troops
then in the town. The main columns were moving
north to the Dixmude region, where the horizon
was red with burning homes. To guard prisoners,
garrison the town and care for the wounded not<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
many soldiers were then needed in Ypres, and non-commissioned
officers mostly were in command.</p>

<p>The streets were empty and silent, and lights only
occasionally seen. At midnight Billy, Henri and
Leon paused in the deep shadow of a tall elm, the
branches of which swept the front of the dingy
red brick dwelling, two stories in height and heavily
hung with vines. Leon knew the place like a
book, for he had been serving as an errand boy
for the guards quartered there.</p>

<p>He whispered to Henri that the men who had
sent the note were in the front room on the second
floor.</p>

<p>Behind the brick wall at the side of the house
was a garden. Billy and Henri, on Leon’s advice,
decided to try the deep-set door in the garden wall
as the only way to get in without stirring up the
sentry in the front hall. With the first push on the
door the rusty hinges creaked loudly.</p>

<p>The front door of the house was thrown open,
and a shaft of light pierced the darkness. The boys
backed up against the wall, scarcely daring to
breathe. The soldier looked up at the clouds,
knocked the ashes out of his pipe, muttered something
to himself, turned back and slammed the door
with a bang. At this the boys gave a backward
heave, and were through the door and into the
garden.</p>

<p>This interior was blacker than the mouth of an<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
inkwell. Billy cautiously forced the door back in
place.</p>

<p>“Got any matches?” Billy had failed to find any
in his own pockets.</p>

<p>Henri was better supplied. In the military aëroplane
he had not only found matches, but also a
box of tapers, and he had taken the precaution of
putting them in his pockets when they left the
machine.</p>

<p>With a little flame, carefully shaded, the boys
discovered a shaky-looking ladder in a grape-arbor
at the back of the garden.</p>

<p>By degrees, foot by foot, they edged the ladder
alongside of the house, and gently hoisted it to the
window of the upper room, which Leon had assured
them was the right one.</p>

<p>“Let’s shy some pebbles against the window to
let them know we are here,” was the whispered
suggestion of Henri.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing.” Billy was going to have a
look in first. He was already crawling up the
ladder. Henri laid hold of the lower rungs, to
keep the rickety frame steady, and Leon stationed
himself at the garden door, ready and alert to give
warning whistle if anything happened in front.</p>

<p>Billy tapped softly on the window pane. The
sash was silently raised, and Billy crept in.</p>

<p>Not a word had been spoken, and no signal from
the room above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[39]</span></p>

<p>Standing in the dark and the rain in the dismal
garden, Henri was of half a mind to follow his
comrade without further delay. It was an anxious
moment.</p>

<p>A bird-like trill from Leon. With this call Henri
left the ladder and tiptoed to the garden door to
join the little Belgian and find out what was the
matter.</p>

<p>From far up the silent street, coming with measured
tread, a regiment was marching. The watchers
at the door of the garden now plainly heard
gruff commands and the other usual sounds of military
movement.</p>

<p>“I must let Billy know; the soldiers are headed
this way and might be coming to move the prisoners
somewhere else.”</p>

<p>Henri had started back toward the house, when
suddenly the window was thrown up, and, with a
sound like the tearing of oil-cloth, Billy came down
the ladder and landed with a bump on the graveled
walk.</p>

<p>Henri and Leon, in the space of a second, rushed
to the side of their fallen comrade.</p>

<p>In the street outside there was a crash that shook
the silence as though the silence was solid. A
regiment had grounded arms directly in front of
the house.</p>

<p>Billy, who for a moment had been stunned by
the force of his bump into the walk, at the end of<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
a twenty-foot slide, jumped to his feet, and in a
breath urged his companions to run.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of this; over the wall with you!”</p>

<p>The boys bolted for the back wall of the garden,
dragging the ladder, and speedily mingled on all
fours on the coping, the top of which was strewn
with broken glass.</p>

<p>Hanging by their hands on the outer side of
the wall they chanced the long drop. As luck would
have it, they landed in soft places&mdash;on a pile of
ashes and garbage.</p>

<p>Lights sprang up in the windows of the house
behind them. It was evident that a change of base
was to be made.</p>

<p>“Did you see our fellows?” was Henri’s first
eager question, as he shook off his coat of ashes.</p>

<p>“You bet I did,” coughed Billy, whose face had
plowed a furrow in the ash heap. “A bunch of
the gray men in a motor boat pounced on them
while they were tinkering with the sea-plane and
took them and the plane in tow to Ostend. They
were brought down here so that General So and So,
I don’t remember who, could look them over, but
the general and his brigade have gone off somewhere
to the north to try and stop the advance of
the Allies. The captain and Freeman both say they
are in no special danger and are very kindly treated.
They have their papers as American citizens and
agents abroad for our factory. Then there is the<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
storm story as their reason for being blown into
the war zone without fighting clothes.</p>

<p>“How did I come to quit that house yonder like
a skyrocket? Well, just as the captain and I had
finished exchanging experiences, and old Josh Freeman
had nearly broken my ribs with a bear hug,
one of the rounders in the house concluded to pay
a visit to the room where we were. We didn’t hear
him until he reached the top of the stairs, where
he stopped to sneeze. With that sneeze I did my
leaping act. That soldier never saw me; I’ll wager
on that.”</p>

<p>“What’ll we do now?” That was more what
Henri wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Get back to the machine before daylight.”
Billy’s main idea was that the safest place was a
couple of thousand feet in the air.</p>

<p>Daylight was not far away. Henri and Leon
held a committee meeting to determine the best route
back to the fortifications. The little Belgian was
sure of his ground, and before sunrise, by countless
twists and turns, the trio were back to the stone
hangar where the aëroplane rested.</p>

<p>The first faint streaks of dawn gave light enough
for Billy to do his tuning work about the machine.
Henri was bending over, in the act of testing the
fuel supply, when there was a thud of horses’ hoofs
on all sides of the enclosure, followed by a shrill
cry from Leon:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sauvez vous! Vite! Vite!</i>” (Save yourself!
Quick! Quick!)</p>

<p>With that the little Belgian frantically tugged at
the aëroplane, and not until our Aviator Boys had
swung the machine into the open and leaped to their
places in the frame did the brave youngster quit his
post. Then he ran like a rabbit, waving quick farewell,
and disappeared in the wilderness of stone.</p>

<p>Lickety clip the aëroplane moved over the ground.
Then up and away!</p>

<p>A pistol shot rang out. A cavalryman nearest to
the point of flight was behind the weapon.</p>

<p>Barely a hundred feet in the air and Henri
leaned heavily against Billy.</p>

<p>“I’m hit!” he gasped, “but don’t let go. Keep her
going!”</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX" class="no-break">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">TESTING BILLY’S NERVE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was indeed a severe test of Billy Barry’s nerve
that was put upon him in this trying moment. To
let go of the controllers of the aëroplane would mean
the finish; to neglect for an instant his comrade,
whom he believed to be bleeding to death, was
agony. Almost blindly he set the planes for a
nearly vertical descent from a dizzy height of three
thousand feet which the machine had attained before<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
Billy had fully realized that he was holding
across his knees the inert body of his beloved
chum. Like a plummet the aircraft dropped eastward.
With rare presence of mind Billy shifted for
a rise when close to the ground, and managed to
land without wrecking the machine. A scant ten
feet, though, to the right, and the aëroplane would
have crashed into a cow-shed and all would have
been over.</p>

<p>An old woman, digging potatoes nearby, was so
frightened when this winged bolt came down from
the sky that she gave a squawk and fell backward
into the big basket behind her.</p>

<p>When Billy had tenderly lifted out and laid
Henri upon the turf, he ran to the well in front
of the neat farmhouse, filled his leather cap with
water, and hastened back to bathe the deathly pale
face and throbbing temples of his wounded chum.
With the cooling application Henri opened his eyes
and smiled at the wild-eyed lad working with all
his soul to win him back to life.</p>

<p>“I am not done for yet, old scout,” he faintly
murmured.</p>

<p>Billy gulped down a sob.</p>

<p>“You’re coming around all right, Buddy, cried
Billy, holding a wet and loving hand upon Henri’s
forehead.</p>

<p>“The pain is in my right shoulder,” advised<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
Henri; “I have just begun to feel it. Guess that is
where the bullet went in.”</p>

<p>“Let me see it.” Billy assumed a severe professional
manner. The attempt, however, to remove
the jacket sleeve from the injured arm
brought forth such a cry of pain from Henri that
Billy drew back in alarm.</p>

<p>“Ask the woman for a pair of shears,” suggested
Henri, “and cut away the sleeve.”</p>

<p>“Hi, there!” called Billy to the old woman, who
had risen from the basket seat, but still all of a
tremble.</p>

<p>“Get her here,” urged Henri. “I can make her
understand.”</p>

<p>Billy, bowing and beckoning, induced the woman
to approach.</p>

<p>Henri, politely:</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame, j’ai ete blesse. Est-ce que nous restons
ici?</i>” (Madam, I have been wounded. Can we
rest here?)</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je n’ecoute pas bien. J’appelerai, Marie.</i>” (I
do not hear good. I will call Marie.)</p>

<p>With that the old woman hobbled away, and
quickly reappeared with “Marie,” a kindly-eyed,
fine type of a girl, of quite superior manner.</p>

<p>Henri questioned: “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous parlez le Français?</i>”
(You speak French?)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[45]</span></p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, monsieur; j’ai demeure en le sud-est.</i>”
(Yes, monsieur; I have lived in the southeast.)</p>

<p>The girl quickly added, with a smiling display of
a fine row of teeth: “And I speak the English, too.
I have nursed the sick in London.”</p>

<p>“Glory be!” Billy using his favorite expression.
“Get busy!”</p>

<p>Marie “got busy” with little pocket scissors, cut
the jacket and shirt free of the wound, washed
away the clotted blood and soon brightly announced:</p>

<p>“No bullet here; it went right through the flesh,
high up; much blood, but no harm to last.”</p>

<p>Cutting up a linen hand-towel, Marie skillfully
bandaged the wound, and, later, as neatly mended
the slashes she had made in Henri’s jacket and shirt.</p>

<p>For ten days the boys rested at the farmhouse,
Henri rapidly recovering strength.</p>

<p>They learned much about Belgium from Marie.
She laughingly told Henri that his French talk was
good to carry him anywhere among the Walloons
in the southeastern half of Belgium, but in the
northwestern half he would not meet many of the
Flemings who could understand him. “You would
have one hard time to speak Flemish,” she assured
him.</p>

<p>Henri confided to Marie that they were bound for
the valley of the Meuse.</p>

<p>“La la,” cried the girl, “but you are taking the<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
long way. Yet,” she continued, “you missed some
fighting by coming the way you did from Bruges.”</p>

<p>On the eleventh morning Henri told Billy at
breakfast that he (Henri) was again as “fit as a
fiddle.” “Let’s be moving,” he urged.</p>

<p>“All right.” Billy himself was getting restless.
They had been absolutely without adventure for
ten long days.</p>

<p>But, when Henri returned from a visit to the
aëroplane, he wore a long face.</p>

<p>“There’s no more ‘ammunition’ in the tanks,” he
wailed. “There isn’t as much as two miles left.”</p>

<p>“That means some hiking on the ground.” With
this remark Billy made a critical survey of his
shoes. “Guess they’ll hold out if the walking is
good.” Henri, however, was not in a humor to
be amused.</p>

<p>“I say, Billy, what’s the matter with making a
try for Roulers? Trouble or no trouble, we’ll not
be standing around like we were hitched. It would
be mighty easy if we could take the air. No use
crying, though, about spilt milk.”</p>

<p>Marie, who had been an attentive listener, putting
on an air of mystery, called the attention of the
boys to a certain spot on the cleanly scrubbed floor,
over which was laid a small rug of home weaving.
The girl pushed aside the rug and underneath was
shown the lines of a trap-door, into which Marie
inserted a chisel point. The opening below disclosed<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
a short flight of steps leading down to an
underground room, where candle light further revealed,
among other household treasures, such as a
collection of antique silver and the like, two modern
bicycles.</p>

<p>“The boys who rode those,” said Marie, pointing
to the cycles, “may never use them again. They
were at Liège when it fell, and never a word from
them since. On good roads and in a flat country
you can travel far on these wheels. Take them,
and welcome, if you have to go.”</p>

<p>In an hour the boys were on the road. They left
two gold-pieces under the tablecloth and a first-class
aëroplane as evidence of good faith.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_X" class="no-break">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ON THE ROAD TO ROULERS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Our Aviator Boys had not for a long time been
accustomed to use their legs as vigorously and so
continuously as required to make an endurance record
on a bicycle. They had no great use for legs
when flying. But they were light-hearted, and had
been well fed, had enough in their knapsacks to
stave off hunger for several days, and, barring the
fact that Henri was still nursing a sore shoulder,
ready to meet the best or the worst. Billy carried<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
a compass, also a mind full of directions from Marie,
and firmly believed that he could not miss the
good old town in the fertile meadow on the little
river Mander. At least Henri and himself could
live or die trying.</p>

<p>They had already observed indications that, even
with the strenuous call to the colors of the Belgian
men, the little kingdom was thickly populated, and
about every square inch of farm land was under
close cultivation.</p>

<p>“Suppose people lived this close together in
Texas,” remarked Billy, as they pedaled along;
“why, a man as tall across the front as Colonel McCready
wouldn’t have room enough to turn
around.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and from what we have heard of the war
crowd working this way we’ll have to have more
room than this to keep from running into them.”
Henri was not in the same mood that he was when
he found the aëroplane tanks empty.</p>

<p>“Nothing like a scare-mark so far,” was Billy’s
comment. “I have seen only women in the fields.”</p>

<p>“Even the dogs have work to do here.”</p>

<p>Henri went on to explain that the small farmers,
as a rule, cannot afford to keep horses, and just now
could not keep them if they had them.</p>

<p>The boys had been fortunate in their first day’s
travel as cyclists, in that they had not even fallen
in with the stragglers of the contending armies reported<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
in terrible conflict inside the Dixmude-Nieuport
line.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the second day, however, they
took the wrong road, one leading to Bixchoote.</p>

<p>In the distance they heard heavy and continuous
artillery fire, and decided to turn back. “Out of
the frying-pan into what next?” as Billy put it,
when they found the woods north of Ypres were
aflame with bursting shells. Fighting in front and
fighting in the rear.</p>

<p>“The sides are still open,” declared Henri, “even
if both ends are plugged.”</p>

<p>“But which side shall it be?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>The situation was one of great peril to the boys.</p>

<p>To get a better idea of the lay of the land, they
rolled their bicycles into the woods alongside the
road and climbed into the low hanging branches of
a huge tree, then ascended to the very top of this
monarch of the forest.</p>

<p>From their lofty perch they could see quite a distance
in all directions, but they had no eyes for
any part of the panorama after the first glance to
the south. The firing line stretched out before their
vision, presenting an awe-inspiring scene.</p>

<p>The shell fire from the German batteries was so
terrific that Belgian soldiers and French marines
were continually being blown out of their dugouts
and sent scattering to cover. The distant town was<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
invisible except for flames and smoke clouds rising
above it.</p>

<p>The tide of battle streamed nearer to the wood
where the boys had taken shelter. From their high
point of vantage they were soon forced to witness
one of the most horrible sights imaginable.</p>

<p>A heavy howitzer shell fell and burst in the
midst of a Belgian battery, which was making its
way to the front, causing awful destruction&mdash;mangled
men and horses going down in heaps.</p>

<p>Henri was in a chill of horror, and Billy so
shaken that it was with difficulty that they resisted
a wild desire to jump into space&mdash;anything to shut
out the appalling picture.</p>

<p>The next instant they were staring down upon
a hand-to-hand conflict in the woods, within two
hundred yards of the tree in which they were
perched. British and Germans were engaged in a
bayonet duel, in which the former force triumphed,
leaving the ground literally covered with German
wounded and dead, hardly a man in gray escaping
the massacre.</p>

<p>“I can see nothing but red!” Henri was shaking
like a leaf.</p>

<p>Billy gave his chum a sharp tap on the cheek
with the palm of his hand, hoping thus to divert
Henri’s mind and restore his courage.</p>

<p>Billy himself had about all he could do to keep<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
his teeth together, but, by the unselfish devotion he
gave to his comrade, he overcame his fear.</p>

<p>“Come, Buddy,” he pleaded; “take a brace!
Easy, now; there’s a way to get out of this, I know
there is. Put your foot here; your hand there;
steady; we’ll be off in a minute.”</p>

<p>By the time the boys had descended to the lower
branches of the tree, Henri was once more on
“even keel,” in the language of the aviator.</p>

<p>A long limb of the tree extended out over the
road. On this the boys wormed their way to the
very tip, intending to drop into the highway, recover
their bicycles, and make a dash for safety
across the country to the west, following the well
defined trail worn smooth by the passage of ammunition
wagons.</p>

<p>As they clung to the limb, intently listening and
alert for any movement that would indicate a returning
tide of battle in the immediate neighborhood,
a riderless horse, a magnificent coal-black
animal, carrying full cavalry equipment, came
galloping down the road, urged to ever increasing
speed by the whipping against its flanks of swinging
holsters.</p>

<p>“Here’s the one chance in the world!”</p>

<p>Billy swung himself around and leaned forward
like a trapeze performer in a circus, preparing
for a high dive into a net.</p>

<p>The horse’s high-flung head just grazed the<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
leaves of the big branch, bent down under the
weight of the boys.</p>

<p>Billy dropped astride of the racing charger,
saved from a heavy fall in the road by getting a
quick neck hold, seized the loose bridle reins with
convulsive grip and brought the foam-flecked animal
to a standstill within fifty yards. This boy had
tamed more than one frisky broncho down in
Texas, U. S. A., and for a horse wearing the kind
of a curb bit in his mouth that this one did, Billy
had a sure brake-setting pull.</p>

<p>Henri made a cat-fall into the dusty road and
right speedily got the hand-up from his mounted
comrade.</p>

<p>Off they went on the trail to the open west,
with clatter of hoofs, and the wind blowing free
in the set, white faces of the gallant riders.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI" class="no-break">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THEY MEET A GENERAL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“I don’t know where we are going, but we’re
on the way,” sang Billy, whose spirits now ranged
to a high pitch. “This beats anything we’ve rung
up yet in our target practice over here,” he gloated.
“Isn’t he a jolly old roadster?” Billy had checked
the horse to a slow canter, after a run of two
miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[53]</span></p>

<p>“Let’s have a bit of a rest.” Henri’s sore shoulder
was troubling him. He still had his knapsack
with some jumbled food in it. Billy had lost his
food supply when he made his leap on the horse.</p>

<p>While the animal was cropping the short grass
along the trail the riders took their ease by lounging
on the turf and feeding on their crumbled
lunch.</p>

<p>“This is a thirsty picnic,” asserted Billy. “My
throat is as dry as powder. Let’s see if there
isn’t a spring ’round here.”</p>

<p>Hooking the bridle reins over his arm, Billy
led the way on a search for water. At the bottom
of a wooded hill the boys found themselves in a
marsh, and though bitter and brackish the water
was a grateful relief to their parched tongues. The
horse acted as though he had not had a drink for
a week.</p>

<p>A little further on, in a meadow, the boys made
a singular discovery. They were amazed to see
an important looking personage in a gorgeous uniform,
covered with decorations, wandering about
the meadow like a strayed sheep.</p>

<p>“What the dickens is that?” exclaimed Henri.</p>

<p>“Give it up.” Billy couldn’t even make a guess.
“He shows gay but harmless. I think I’ll look him
over.”</p>

<p>On approaching the richly attired wanderer the
boys with wonder noticed that he carried a gold-tipped<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
baton and from a shiny knapsack on his
shoulders rolls of music protruded.</p>

<p>The strange being kept proclaiming that he was
going to direct the German military music on a
triumphal parade through the streets of Paris.
Henri could understand that much of the disconnected
talk, and also that the speaker was the head
musician of the German army in Belgium. He had
been cut off from his command and become possessed
by a fit of melancholy from which the boys
found it impossible to rouse him. They divided
with him what remained of the contents of Henri’s
knapsack, but could not induce him to proceed
with them.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity that a man like that should lose
his reason. But this dreadful war strikes in most
any kind of way, and if it isn’t one way it’s another.”</p>

<p>Henri was still thinking of the horrible happening
when the Belgian battery was literally blown
to pieces under his very eyes.</p>

<p>“There’s a peaceful sleeper here, anyhow,” said
Billy, pausing, as they trudged along, leading the
horse toward the trail. He pointed to a little
mound above which had been set a rude wooden
cross. It was the grave of a French soldier, for
on the cross had been placed his cap, showing
the name of his regiment. On the mound, too, had
been scattered a few wild flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[55]</span></p>

<p>“Somebody who had a heart for the cause or
the fighter must have passed this way,” observed
Henri. “The burial of a soldier near the battle
lines hasn’t much ceremony, I am told, and surely
doesn’t include flowers.”</p>

<p>The boys slept that night in the open, with the
saddle for a pillow. They were awakened just
before dawn by the restless antics of Bon Ami
(“Good Friend”)&mdash;for so Henri had named the
horse. The animal snorted and tugged at the
tether as if scenting some invisible approach
through the woods, at the edge of which the three
had been passing the night.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri were on their feet in an instant,
rubbing their eyes and trying to locate by
sight or sound among the trees or elsewhere in
the shadowy landscape the cause of Bon Ami’s
disturbed action.</p>

<p>Even if the boys had suddenly made up their
minds to run to cover, they would not have had time
to go very far, for in the instant a scout troop
rode out of the woods and straight at them.</p>

<p>The cavalrymen spread in fan shape, and in a
moment Billy, Henri and Bon Ami were completely
surrounded.</p>

<p>In good but gruff English the ranking officer
of the troop commanded: “Come here and give
an account of yourselves.”</p>

<p>Billy and Henri made haste to obey, and looking<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
up at the officer on horseback offered their
smartest imitation of a military salute. Peering
down at them the cavalryman exclaimed:</p>

<p>“So help me, they’re mere boys. Who let you
out, my fine kiddies, at this top of the morning?
Here, Ned,” calling to one of the nearest troopers,
“bring the hot milk and the porridge.”</p>

<p>Billy was becoming slightly nettled at this banter.
He had no desire to be taken seriously, but
yet not quite so lightly.</p>

<p>“I am an American citizen, sir, traveling, with
my friend, on personal business.”</p>

<p>“Will you listen at that now?” laughed the
cavalryman whom the first officer had called “Ned.”</p>

<p>“Do you know or have you thought that ‘personal
business’ is just now rather a drug on the
market in these parts?”</p>

<p>The chief was again addressing the boys, or,
rather, Billy, who had elected himself spokesman.</p>

<p>“It does appear that the soldiers have the right
of way here,” admitted Billy, “but we came in
such a hurry that we couldn’t stop to inquire in
particular about the rules.”</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty good horse you have.” It was
light enough now for the officer to take in the
fine points of Bon Ami. “Where did you get him?”</p>

<p>Billy explained the circumstances.</p>

<p>“Well, you are plucky ones,” commented the officer.
“Now,” he continued, assuming again the<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
tone of command, “saddle your steed and fall in.”</p>

<p>The troop wheeled back toward the north and
the boys rode stirrup to stirrup with the bluff
captain.</p>

<p>At the noon hour the riders reached the field
working quarters of the British commander. A
small headquarters guard lounged on the grass
around the farmhouse that sheltered the general
and his staff, a dozen automobiles and motorcycles
were at hand and grooms were leading about the
chargers of the officers.</p>

<p>The scout troop halted at a respectful distance
and dismounted.</p>

<p>“Put on your best manners,” suggested the troop
captain as he preceded the boys in quickstep to
headquarters.</p>

<p>After a brief conference with an orderly, the
boys were ushered into the presence of several
officers in fatigue uniform seated at a table littered
with papers. At the head of the table was a ruddy-faced
man, clean-shaven, with iron-gray hair, to
whom all heads bent in deference.</p>

<p>“We have visitors, I see.” The general’s tone
and manner were kindly.</p>

<p>The boys stood speechless, their eyes fixed upon
the little Maltese badge of honor suspended from
the left breast of the general’s coat by a crimson
ribbon. It was the Victoria Cross!</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">WITH THE BRITISH ARMY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Now, my young men,” said the general, speaking
briskly and to the point, “what are you doing here,
where are you going, and is there anything else
you wish to say?”</p>

<p>As Billy had not as yet opened his mouth, he
thought the general was rather ahead of his questions
in the last quoted particular.</p>

<p>“Allow me, general, to introduce Mr. Trouville,
a native of France, who only lacks the years to
vote in America. He has the desire, I assure you.
As for myself, I am William Thomas Barry of
Maine, United States of America, known as Billy&mdash;and
together we are known as the Aviator Boys.
We are in the flying trade, and with your kind
permission we would like to fly now.”</p>

<p>The officers observed the boys with new interest.
The London <cite>Times</cite> had some months ago
printed the experiences of a prominent English
visitor to America, who had seen these young
aërialists in some of their sky-scraping exhibits,
and had even taken a short flight with Billy.</p>

<p>“We military fellows are all great for aviation&mdash;it’s
a big card in this war game”&mdash;this observation
from the member of staff seated nearest the general&mdash;a<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
thoroughbred sort of man who also wore
the badge of valor. “And more than that,” he
added, “I have a boy of my own in the flying corps
of the army.”</p>

<p>It occurred to Billy that this officer might care
to hear the sad story of the death flight of the
British youth that they had witnessed on the shores
of the North Sea.</p>

<p>Billy, in real dramatic style, described the thrilling
incident. There was no lack of attention on
the part of his listeners; especially did the man
who looked like a thoroughbred seem lost to everything
else but the tale the boy was so earnestly
telling. When Billy produced from the inside
pocket of his blouse the photograph and ring that
he had taken from the heart pocket and finger
of the dead aviator there was strained silence, first
broken by the man who had been most intent as
a listener.</p>

<p>“It was my boy, my own son!”</p>

<p>This man who had faced shot and shell with
never a tremor on many a blackened battlefield,
and had won the magic initials “V. C.” after his
name, bowed his head in grief and not ashamed
of the sob in his throat.</p>

<p>“Some day, God willing,” he softly said to Billy,
“you shall guide his mother and me to that resting
place.”</p>

<p>A bugle call outside aroused the officers to the<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
grim business of the hour. The roar of another
battle would soon be on.</p>

<p>The general turned the boys over to the care
of a veteran soldier, a sergeant, with strict orders
that they should not be allowed to leave the
rear of the brigade about to advance.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri, however, had the opportunity
of observing during their first actual army experience,
even though of the rear guard, the striking
device of a French officer in order to steady
his men, in an infantry regiment, called upon for
the first time to face the discharge of German
shells. For a moment the men hesitated, and even
made a slight movement of withdrawal. Instantly
the officer seemed to have taken in the situation.
The boys heard him shout:</p>

<p>“Halt! Order arms!”</p>

<p>Then, quite coolly, he turned his back upon the
enemy&mdash;for the first and last time&mdash;whipped out
his camera, called upon his men not to move, and
proceeded to take a leisurely snapshot of his company
while shells were falling all around.</p>

<p>The men were astonished, but the officer’s purpose
was served. The company was steadied, and
the boys, from the top of a supply wagon, watched
them go gallantly to work. Sad to relate, the
watchers also saw the gallant officer fall soon afterward,
struck on the head by a fragment of shell.</p>

<p>“I tell you, General Sherman was right in what<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
he said about war.” Billy was very positive in this
expression of opinion.</p>

<p>On that day of fearful fighting the boys saw
an entire German regiment perish in the rush of
water which swept through the trenches after the
Allies had destroyed the dikes; they saw hundreds
of men and horses electrocuted on the heavily
charged wire entanglements before the trenches.</p>

<p>At nightfall Billy and Henri, heartsick with the
horror of it all, crawled under the wagon cover
and fought nightmares through the long hours before
another day.</p>

<p>It was raining in torrents when the boys peeped
through the tear in the wagon shelter early the
next morning, and it had turned sharply cold. The
roar of the batteries had slackened for the time
being, and it was a welcome moment for Billy
and Henri, who on the day previous had heard
more gunpowder racket than ever they did on all
the Fourths of July they had ever known rolled
into one.</p>

<p>Stepping out gingerly into the mud, the boys
looked around for their friendly guardian, Sergeant
Scott. He was nowhere to be seen among
the few soldiers in khaki uniforms and woolen
caps moving about among the wagons. They soon
learned that the sergeant had made a capture during
the night of one of the enemy’s secret agents who
had penetrated the lines for the purpose of cutting<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
telephone wires. The spy or sniper carried cutters
and a rifle. From behind the lines with the rifle
he had been shooting at men passing to and fro,
but when he ventured inside with the cutters the
sergeant nabbed him, though the invader was
cleverly disguised in British outfit. Both captor
and captive were up-field at an “interview,” from
which only the sergeant returned.</p>

<p>When he observed the boys shivering in their
tracks, Sergeant Scott called to a teamster to fetch
a blanket from one of the wagons. Borrowing
a knife from the teamster, the sergeant slashed
the big army blanket in two in the middle, doubled
each fold and made two slits in the top.</p>

<p>“Jump into these, my Jackies,” he ordered;
“shove your arms through. Now you won’t catch
a frog in your lungs, and you’re swell enough to
make a bet on the races. Come along and tighten
your belts with something in the way of rations.”</p>

<p>The boys needed no second bidding, and their
belts were very snug when they had finished.</p>

<p>“By the way,” confided the sergeant, “Colonel
Bainbridge has taken a heap of interest in you
youngsters. His son, I heard, lost his life in one
of those flying machines.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we were the ones that told him about it.
He’s sure a grand man,” added Billy.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued the sergeant, “there are some
of us going to work around toward Lille and the<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
River Lys region to assist in extension of the Allies’
line there. If Colonel Bainbridge commands
the movement, between ‘you and I and the gate-post,’
yours truly wants to go ’long.”</p>

<p>“So do we!” The boys spoke as one.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII" class="no-break">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE BOYS UNDER FIRE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Colonel Bainbridge did command, and Sergeant
Scott, Billy Barry and Henri Trouville went
along.</p>

<p>“I wish they would let us ride Bon Ami.”</p>

<p>Billy had noted the handsome horse they had
captured prancing along carrying a heavyweight
cavalryman, while Henri and himself were perched
beside a teamster on the front seat of a supply
wagon.</p>

<p>“Maybe they were afraid that you would run
away,” drawled the teamster. “Sergeant Scott says
you’re too skittish to turn loose.”</p>

<p>“The sergeant will be putting handcuffs on us
next,” laughed Billy.</p>

<p>The teamster set his teeth in a plug of tobacco,
snapped the whiplash over the big bay team and
with a twinkle in his eye started the verse of some
soldier ditty:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[64]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">“‘Said Colonel Malone to the sergeant bold,</div>
<div class="indent0">These are the traps I give you to hold,</div>
<div class="indent2">If they are gone when I come back</div>
<div class="indent2">You’re just the boy I’ll put on the rack.’”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“That’s just it,” added the teamster, changing
from song to the usual drawl, “if the sergeant lets
you come to harm the colonel would cut the stripes
from his coat. And what’s more the sergeant is
kind of struck on you himself. Git-ap,”&mdash;to the
horses.</p>

<p>It was at the crossing of the Lys at Warneton
that the boys had another baptism of fire.</p>

<p>The crossing was strongly held by the Germans
with a barricade loopholed at the bottom to enable
the men to fire while lying down. The Allies’
cavalry, with the artillery, blew the barricade to
pieces and scattered the defenders.</p>

<p>In the square of the town the boys saw the
greatest display of fireworks that ever dazzled their
young eyes.</p>

<p>One of the buildings appeared to leap skyward.
A sheet of flame and a shower of star shells at
the same time made the place as light as day.</p>

<p>Out of the surrounding houses the Germans
poured a terrific fire from rifles and machine guns.</p>

<p>The Allies’ cavalry got away with a loss of eight
or nine men, and Sergeant Scott headed volunteers<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
that went back and carried away wounded comrades
from this dreadful place.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri rushed at the sergeant when he
returned from this daring performance and joined
hands in a sort of war dance around their hero.</p>

<p>“The Victoria Cross for yours, old top!” cried
Billy.</p>

<p>“You ought to have it this minute!” echoed
Henri.</p>

<p>“Quit your jabber, you chatterboxes,” said the
big sergeant playfully, shaking his fist at his admirers,
but it could be plainly seen that he was
mightily pleased with the demonstration.</p>

<p>“You and I will have to do something to keep
up with this man,” remarked Billy to Henri, with
a mock bow to the sergeant.</p>

<p>“None of that,” growled the sergeant, “your
skylarking doesn’t go on the ground, and not on
this ground, anyhow.”</p>

<p>But the boys had grown tired of being just in
the picture and not in its making.</p>

<p>“The sergeant doesn’t seem to think that we
have ever crossed a danger line the way he coddles
us.” Billy was ready for argument on this point.</p>

<p>“Wish we had him up in the air a little while,”
said Henri, “he wouldn’t be so quick to dictate.”</p>

<p>It was in this mood, during the advance and on
the night of the next day, that the boys eluded<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
the vigilant eye of the sergeant long enough to
attempt a look around on their own account.</p>

<p>In the dark they stumbled on the German
trenches.</p>

<p>Billy grasped Henri’s arm and they turned and
made for the British lines, as fast as their legs
could carry them, but the fire directed at them was
so heavy that they had to throw themselves on
the ground and crawl.</p>

<p>There was no cover at hand, and the chances
looked mighty desperate for the pair, when Billy
saw, close by, an enormous hole in the ground,
made by the explosion of a “black maria,” the
name given by the soldiers to the projectiles of the
big German howitzers.</p>

<p>Into this the boys scrambled, panting and scared
to the limit.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t this jar you?”</p>

<p>Henri had no answer to Billy’s quickfire query.
He didn’t think it required any just then. He was
“jarred,” in the way the word was used.</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty pickle we’re in,” Henri managed
to say when a shell screamed over the hole.</p>

<p>“It sure is,” admitted Billy, as a round-shot scattered
dust particles and showered them into the
hiding place.</p>

<p>“‘We won’t go home till morning,’” this warble
by Henri, a rather feeble attempt to be gay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe you won’t go home at all,” was the
gloomy expression of opinion by Billy.</p>

<p>“I wonder if the sergeant has missed us yet?”
Henri was wondering.</p>

<p>The ground was shaking and then a sound as
though the earth was being hammered with ten
thousand clubs in as many giant hands.</p>

<p>In the early dawn the Allies were charging the
German entrenchments.</p>

<p>The howitzers thundered; battle cries and commands
resounded.</p>

<p>The Allies’ forces whirled by and on both sides
of the underground shelter where the boys were
crouching.</p>

<p>With the clash of arms behind them Billy and
Henri clambered out of the hole and spurted for
dear life and safety.</p>

<p>When the troopers came back from the fight,
the sergeant, with heavy stride, came to the wagon
into which the boys had crawled.</p>

<p>“Come out of there,” he commanded.</p>

<p>The boys instantly obeyed and in sheepish manner
presented themselves to the severely erect soldier.</p>

<p>“You’ll be buried without the benefit of a
preacher if you try another trick like that.” This
was all the sergeant said, but he looked daggers.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV" class="no-break">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN AN ARMORED MOTOR CAR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>On the way to Arras the boys had their first
experience aboard an armored motor car, equipped
with machine guns. Quite a promotion from the
teamster’s seat of a supply wagon!</p>

<p>How the sergeant ever consented to let his
charges join the crew of Belgians operating the
war machine is not known. Perhaps he was not
told until it was too late to object.</p>

<p>But there they were, Billy and Henri, as large
as life, out “Uhlan hunting,” as the soldiers put
it. The boys knew that a Uhlan was a kind of
light cavalry, or lancer, in the German army, and
they had heard that he was “game,” but never before
in the sense of game to be hunted.</p>

<p>As for that, hardly a day passed but the boys
learned something new from the soldiers.</p>

<p>But a short time before at La Bassee they had
seen one of these armored cars return from a dash
ahead of the main body loaded with spoils in the
shape of lancer caps, busbies, helmets, lances, rifles,
and other trophies, which the crew distributed as
souvenirs to a crowd in the market place.</p>

<p>The next day one of the cars that went out never<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
came back. The Uhlans probably took it for a
trophy.</p>

<p>Whenever you see a splendid piece of tapestry
or hangings displayed in a window, museum, or
house, you may think of Arras, the little old town
on the right bank of the narrow little river Scarpe,
right in the center of the line of battle between
Lille and Amiens, and remember that our boys
were now following that line in France.</p>

<p>From the armored car the boys in the distance
saw that famous old belfry, said to be 240 feet
high, rising gracefully above the town hall, and
on top of which was a huge crown. A day later
this tower was wrecked by a shell in furious bombardment.</p>

<p>During this journey in the armored car the boys
were filled with admiration of the dash and skill
displayed by the Belgian crew. They were also
greatly interested in the hardy cyclists, who apparently
without effort kept up with the pace of
the big machine. In some of the villages through
which they passed, the inhabitants met the cyclists
with kisses, in some of the roads the cyclists met
barricades and machine guns.</p>

<p>“If a doctor told you that you needed change
to help your health, Henri, you can write him that
you’re getting it.”</p>

<p>Billy was finding this new war game very much
to his liking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[70]</span></p>

<p>“You’ll have word from the doctor without writing,”
retorted Henri, “if you don’t quit standing
up in the car.”</p>

<p>Even then bullets were whizzing past them. The
car had suddenly come upon a small party of the
German mounted troops, firing with short-arms
from the saddle.</p>

<p>The Belgian gunners instantly responded from
the car and swept the road.</p>

<p>“On to Arras!”</p>

<p>Billy made the grim soldiers smile with his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>When the car rolled into the quaint old town
of Arras, the boys confessed that they had never
seen quite the like of it before.</p>

<p>“There’s a building that I’d like to move to
Bangor,” said Billy, pointing to the Hotel de Ville,
one of the finest in France, with its Gothic façade
rising upon seven arches of different sizes.</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of rare old houses here, I tell
you,” asserted Henri, “but I never saw them until
now, except on postcards. By the way, Billy, take
a look at those and think of the days of Christopher
Columbus.”</p>

<p>Henri referred to the Petite place and the Grande
place, curious relics of the long gone days of
Spanish rule, with their queer gables and old arcades
resting on curiously shaped sand-stone columns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[71]</span></p>

<p>“This is the town, you know,” advised Henri,
“where Robespierre was born.”</p>

<p>“Humph! This war has kicked up a bigger
muss in France than ‘Roby’ ever did.”</p>

<p>Billy was not inclined to concede that anything
had ever created a stir ahead of that in which he
was mixing.</p>

<p>The stir of the next day was, indeed, something
to be remembered. Some of the biggest of the
German guns were brought into action.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri had been napping, and never
were naps more rudely disturbed.</p>

<p>Shells from the great guns used by the bombarding
forces had a way of starting on their
course with a minute-long shriek, which seemed
to come from the shell itself. When the boys’
eyes had been cleared from sleep they could not
only plainly see the projectiles in the beginning
of their flight, but also distinctly observe the bellowing
air rushing back to fill the vacancy left by
the discharge and bounding and rebounding in a
disturbed sea of gas.</p>

<p>“What a sight!” cried Billy when the first period
of nervous strain had passed.</p>

<p>“Something fierce.” Henri’s comment was boy-like.</p>

<p>The boys were pacing in one of the antique streets
with fragments of wood and chips of stone falling<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
about them when they heard a shout, followed
down the avenue by the shouter. It was the sergeant
rattling like a milk wagon with his military
fixings.</p>

<p>“Hustle, you young bearcats; get to cover!”</p>

<p>With that the sergeant yanked each boy by the
shoulder into a hospital building nearby.</p>

<p>“Here’s help for you,” said the sergeant to one
of the Red Cross nurses. “Keep them busy, and,”
he added with especial emphasis, “inside.”</p>

<p>That gentle nurse, a young English girl, the
boys learned afterward, was struck by a shell and
carried dying on a litter from a battlefield where
she had been attending the wounded. Her name
was Winnie Bell, and she rests in the cemetery at
Le Mans, with the bodies of French and German
soldiers around her, in whose service she gave up
her noble young life.</p>

<p>The boys moved about with the nurse among
the wounded, constantly growing in number.</p>

<p>“Oh! the pity of it all,” she murmured, putting
a cup of water to the quivering lips of a sufferer,
a mere lad, wearing the brilliant uniform of a
French trooper, with a gaping wound in his shoulder.</p>

<p>Henri, leaning forward to give the nurse a bandage
from the packet he was carrying, caught sight
of the soldier’s upturned face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[73]</span></p>

<p>“My brother Francois!” he moaned, dropping on
his knees beside the litter.</p>

<p>The wounded soldier opened his eyes, and the
agony of his hurt did not keep him from smiling.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV" class="no-break">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">FAREWELL TO FRANCOIS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“You’re feeling better now; I know you are;
really, you must say that, Francois. I can’t bear to
see you lying there so still and so white.”</p>

<p>Henri hovered about the cot of his wounded
brother after the surgeon had dressed and bandaged
the injured shoulder.</p>

<p>He had forgotten the war storm that raged outside,
and even for the moment ceased to remember
that his dearest chum, Billy, was ever at his
elbow with ready sympathy.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Francois,” Henri pleaded, “that you
are going to get well.”</p>

<p>“Of course he is,” assured a mild voice from
the foot of the cot, “but you must come away and
give him a chance to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Sleep! With all that roar outside?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, my boy, the surgeon gave him something
that would tend to quiet him. You must calm
yourself, and remember that you have your duty
with me. He did his duty without fear or question.<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
Are you less a man than your brother?”</p>

<p>The nurse well knew how to manage in a case
of this kind. She had tested the metal of a proud
young spirit, in the full belief that it would ring
true.</p>

<p>“Come along now,” she gently urged. “Let me
show you that thought of self does not fit here.”</p>

<p>They stood at the cot side of a mortally wounded
Belgian soldier.</p>

<p>“We found a letter in his pocket,” softly voiced
the nurse, “saying that he was enclosing a pair
of shoes for his three-year-old baby with the money
he had earned as a scout in King Albert’s army.
Here are the little shoes,” lying on the covering
sheet.</p>

<p>Billy felt like he was choking, and Henri simply
lifted the border of the nurse’s apron to his lips.</p>

<p>It was several days before Henri obtained permission
to talk with his brother. There was so
much to talk about that the few minutes allowed
were as so many seconds.</p>

<p>“But I’ve news from mother!” confided Henri
to Billy&mdash;“she was all right when Francois last
saw her in Paris, and she got the word I sent her
about my going to the château, and why I was
going. It was Francois who wrote me about the
gold and jewels being left behind. Mother tried to
get word to me not to take the risk; she said that
more than all else she wanted me to come straight<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
to her if I could. It makes me ashamed to see
Jules and Francois under the colors and I without,
but I’ve made up my mind to do this thing I
have set out to do, and I’ll stick until it is finished.”</p>

<p>“You can count me in to the finish, Buddy. You
stick to the job and you can safely bet that I’ll
stick to you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t I know that, my truest of friends?”</p>

<p>Henri gave Billy a hand-squeeze that made that
husky youngster wince.</p>

<p>Francois was rapidly regaining strength, his
wound nicely healing, and, with the progress, his
interest in Henri’s mission to the Meuse was first
in mind.</p>

<p>“In my letter,” he said to Henri, “I feared to give
details that might be read by other eyes than yours.
You only would know even the name and location
of our house by that letter. But I got it all right
from mother about the secret hiding place of the
fortune.</p>

<p>“Neither Jules, you, nor I had ever learned of
the more than a century-old plan of the Château
Trouville, handed down by a great-grandfather,
which included an underground way from the hills
through the valley and ending in the north wing
of the château.</p>

<p>“Mother herself had almost forgotten that such
a place was in existence until she recalled that some
thirty years ago our father gave her what he jokingly<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
called a honeymoon trip through the tunnel,
and she also recalled that it was a journey which
she never repeated. She spoiled a new dress going
through.</p>

<p>“Of course, you and I know that the old house
itself is full of queer corners, walks between the
walls, panel openings and all that; we played hide-and-seek
there enough, but the outside passage
we never struck. Father might have told us about
it if he had lived.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the tunnel came in handy when old
times were squally,” suggested Henri.</p>

<p>“Never handier, I think, than it may be to you
if you ever get within a mile of what you are going
after,” replied Francois; “you will never get in
by the front door the way things are now.”</p>

<p>“Wish you would go along with Billy and me.”</p>

<p>“Not I. I travel only under orders. I am a
soldier. You are still your own master. Now,
while you are here, ask nurse to hand you my coat,
if there is anything left of it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, thank you, nurse.”</p>

<p>“Feel in the lining back of the breast pocket,
Henri. That’s it. Cut the seam, brother. There
you are.”</p>

<p>Henri held in his hand a thin roll of paper.</p>

<p>“Open it.”</p>

<p>Henri did as directed and saw that it was a
miniature map, lined with red ink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[77]</span></p>

<p>With their heads together the brothers studied
the outlines, Francois explaining that he made this
copy from a section of the original parchment.</p>

<p>“Jules has a copy, too,” continued Francois, “but
he is in the same boat with me&mdash;he can’t quit his
post. As I said before, it’s up to you and your
friend to get the family treasure out of the château.
If you can get near enough, this paper will show
you the way to get in and out unseen, even if the
house be full of soldiers.”</p>

<p>Henri borrowed needle and thread from the
nurse and sewed the paper inside the collar of his
blouse.</p>

<p>A week later the sergeant informed the boys that
marching orders had been given, and they were to
move with a detachment to the southwest.</p>

<p>“Going our way, hurrah!”</p>

<p>Henri then remembered that this meant parting
from his brother, and was less inclined to rejoice
when this sad thought came to his mind.</p>

<p>Francois was seated near one of the low windows
of the hospital building, enjoying the bright sunlight
that shone through the open casement.</p>

<p>He had a smile in his eyes when he saw Henri,
with knapsack on his back, approaching.</p>

<p>“I know it’s good-by, brother,” he said. “But
take it easy, old boy. We’ll have a grand reunion
some day.”</p>

<p>Henri lovingly clasped the free hand of the<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
young soldier, in silent farewell, bravely squared
his shoulders and marched away to join Billy and
the sergeant, waiting at the door.</p>

<p>A bugle sounded and the soldier column swung
away from war-torn Arras.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI" class="no-break">CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE VALLEY OF THE MEUSE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>From a hillside the boys looked upon and over
the great battlefield where the German army was
then trying to break through the line of barrier
forts between Verdun and Toul and the opposing
French forces.</p>

<p>In front lay the level valley of the Meuse, with
the towns of St. Mihiel and Bannoncour nestling
upon the green landscape.</p>

<p>Beyond and behind the valley rose a tier of
hills on which the French were then striving with
all their might to hold an intrenched position.</p>

<p>Bursting shells were throwing up columns of
white or black fog, and cloudlets of white smoke
here and there showed where a position was under
shrapnel fire.</p>

<p>The sergeant had presented the boys with a high-powered
field glass, and to their delight they picked
out an occasional aëroplane hovering over the lines.</p>

<p>“Look at that little snapper,” cried Billy; “that’s<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
a French wasp; it’s smaller and lighter than our
kind; they call it the ‘peasant’s terror.’ Gee! Seventy-five
miles an hour is nothing to that plane.”</p>

<p>“The aviator is giving signals!”</p>

<p>Henri had his eyes glued to the glass.</p>

<p>“Looks like a hawk circling around a chick.”</p>

<p>Billy was again taking his turn.</p>

<p>“He’d better climb quick.”</p>

<p>Henri noted that some of the big mortars were
trying for the airman, and he had learned that
these mortars could throw a shell a mile or more
in the air.</p>

<p>The aviator evidently was aware of the fact,
too, for he went higher and higher, until the machine
looked like a mere scratch in the sky.</p>

<p>The boys returned to the trenches with Rene
Granger, a lad of eighteen, who had enlisted, he
said, at Lorraine, and who had already won the
rank of corporal in a French regiment.</p>

<p>The three were together when the colonel of
Rene’s regiment called for a volunteer to carry
the orders of the staff to the different companies.
The colonel did not conceal the fact that the mission
was one of great danger. The young corporal
stepped forward, and offered his service. He listened
attentively to the colonel’s instructions. Then
with a quiet <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c’est bien</i> (it is well), he started.</p>

<p>The boys saw him reach the first trench in safety
and deliver his message.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[80]</span></p>

<p>The next stage of his journey was a dangerous
one, for he had to pass over an open space of
300 yards, swept by the enemy’s fire. He went
down on his hands and knees and crawled, only
lifting his head in order to see his way.</p>

<p>Within a few yards of the trenches a bullet
struck him in the thigh. He crept behind a tree,
hastily dressed the wound, then dragged himself
to the trench, where he delivered his message to
the commander.</p>

<p>They tried to stop him there, but the boy refused.</p>

<p>“I have given my word,” he said.</p>

<p>There remained still two companies to visit.
One of them was quite near, but the other was
600 yards away, far advanced in the zone of fire.</p>

<p>Rene began his terrible journey. At every few
yards he was compelled to stop, so fierce was the
suffering caused by his wound. Bullets whistled
around him, and one pierced his kepi.</p>

<p>He was within twenty yards of safety when a
shell burst in front of him and fragments struck
him, inflicting a terrible wound. He lay unconscious,
but he had been seen from the trenches and
two ambulance men ran out, placed him on a
stretcher, and carried him to their company.</p>

<p>Rene became conscious once more, called for the
commanding officer, and almost with his last breath
whispered the orders he had been given.</p>

<p>“Oh, that he could have lived!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[81]</span></p>

<p>Henri could scarcely realize that their new-found
friend, their cheery companion of the past few
days, was cold in death. But they brought him
back to his regiment, in scarred body, for honor.</p>

<p>“He kept his word,” said the colonel, who turned
away that none might see what a soldier must hide.</p>

<p>“There’s a boy that was all gold; I am grateful
for having known him, and better for it, too; he
knew how to live and how to die.”</p>

<p>This was Billy’s brief but heartfelt tribute to
the memory of their fallen comrade.</p>

<p>But our boys must push on to their goal, and
though their story must be seamed and crossed by
these woes of war, yet it is their story.</p>

<p>“Château Chantillon still stands, and there is
Château Chambley, and there, yes, there, is Château
Trouville&mdash;my home.”</p>

<p>Henri was drawing the distance close with the
powerful field glass, and talking over his shoulder
to Billy.</p>

<p>“With a wall of steel around them,” commented
Billy.</p>

<p>“But we are going to get through it,” was Henri’s
determined reply.</p>

<p>“Speed the day!”</p>

<p>Billy was ready for the effort. Besides, he had
been thinking a good deal about Bangor in the last
few days.</p>

<p>“If those old guns over there,” said Henri,<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
“would only let us alone until we found the mouth
of that tunnel it’s a sure thing that we could be
under the roof of the Trouvilles in less than two
hours.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the old map’s no good.”</p>

<p>Billy never had been much of a hand for ancient
history.</p>

<p>“If it’s all the same to you, we’ll give it a test
to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>Henri did not take kindly to Billy’s unbelief.</p>

<p>“If we can get away from the sergeant, I will
be at your heels,” announced Billy, and he meant
every word of it.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII" class="no-break">CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE POINT OF ROCKS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The French and allied forces were located in a
range of wooded hills running north and south
along the east bank of the Meuse. They had fortified
steeply terraced slopes with successive rows
of trenches, permitting line above line of infantry
to fire against an advancing enemy.</p>

<p>At the foot of the hillside is the village of Vignueilles,
a little stone-built town that had been shot
into ruins by artillery. A boy from this village,
who had taken refuge with the soldiers on the high<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
ground, found a former playmate when he met
Henri. This boy’s father had once been employed
as a gardener by the Trouvilles.</p>

<p>As Billy said, “they jabbered French until they
made him tired.”</p>

<p>The new friend had the given name of Joseph,
but Henri called him “Reddy.” Billy called him a
“muff,” because he could not understand half that
the new boy said.</p>

<p>But Joseph, or Reddy, by any name was just
now a tower of strength, even if the tower was
only five feet three inches up from the ground.</p>

<p>As Leon, the little Belgian, served at Ypres, so
Reddy was going to prove a big help in the adventure
at hand.</p>

<p>He had chased rabbits into almost every hole in
these hills, and in the woods he could travel even beyond
the German frontier by as many different
routes as he counted fingers on his hands.</p>

<p>Billy, Henri and Reddy were in close conference
all day, so quiet, and so cautious, for the once, in
their movements, that the sergeant wavered between
suspicion and anxiety, the first because he
thought his charges must be up to something, and
the second for the reason that he feared they were
going to be ill.</p>

<p>He might have imagined relief from anxiety by
thinking the boys were tremendously hungry had<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
he seen their frequent trips during the day to the
places where provisions were stored.</p>

<p>Had he seen them, however, taking several small
safety lanterns from the ammunition department,
suspicion would have stood first in his mind.</p>

<p>“The tunnel begins at a point 500 yards directly
west of Fort Les Paroches, and it is called ‘point
of rocks,’” Henri reading the notes and following
with a pin point the lines of the little map that
Francois had given him.</p>

<p>The mentioned fort had been silenced only the
day before by German mortars, and its location was
now marked by a huge mound of black, plowed
up earth.</p>

<p>“That’s only three miles from here.”</p>

<p>Reddy was eager to show his knowledge of the
neighborhood.</p>

<p>Henri passed Reddy’s statements on to Billy in
English.</p>

<p>“‘Bowlders laid in the form of a cross show the
place of entrance,’” Henri continuing to read.</p>

<p>“‘Stone slab at foot of cross. Remove stone and
find iron ring in oak cover. Lift cover and find
stone steps.’”</p>

<p>“Seems simple enough if we had a derrick.”</p>

<p>Billy was still doubtful.</p>

<p>“The only thing I fear,” said Henri, paying no
attention to Billy’s pert remark, “is that with time<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
the markings may be wiped out by changes of earth
formation, forest growth or the like.”</p>

<p>“No,” quickly advised Reddy, “if it’s the place
that I’ve seen there are still a lot of rocks there.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you could find the place for us,
couldn’t you, Reddy?” asked Henri.</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes!”</p>

<p>Reddy was on his feet to furnish proof without
further delay.</p>

<p>“We can get there through the ravine,” he was
in a hurry to add.</p>

<p>“When the sergeant goes to inspect the outposts,
then, let’s make the break.”</p>

<p>Billy was catching the spirit of the occasion.</p>

<p>So it was while good Sergeant Scott was performing
a military duty the boys shouldered their
well filled knapsacks, and, with Reddy leading, in
the dusk succeeded in eluding the sentry first in
the way.</p>

<p>The cunning of Reddy as a woodsman was wonderfully
shown by the manner in which he took to
the brush and the way he avoided notice. It
seemed hardly any time at all before the boys were
silently picking their way, shadow-like, in the
depths of the pitch-dark ravine.</p>

<p>They had heard no challenge until Billy planted
his foot on a fallen twig, which cracked like a pistol
shot.</p>

<p>“Who goes there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[86]</span></p>

<p>Sharp question, in French, from above.</p>

<p>Down went the boys flat on the ground, concealed
by overhanging bushes.</p>

<p>The sentry repeated the challenge.</p>

<p>All as silent as the grave.</p>

<p>The boys scarcely breathed. They knew the
guard was one of the allied forces, but yet they
had no desire to take issue with him. Even if he
only turned them back to quarters their chances of
getting away again would be few and far between.
The sergeant would see to that.</p>

<p>Some ten minutes passed. It seemed longer to
the truants in the ravine.</p>

<p>Then, as if satisfied that the noise was without
menace, the sentry resumed his pace, and the
boys flitted on as if shod with velvet.</p>

<p>The path took an upward turn, and Reddy
nudged his companions to a halt.</p>

<p>“We’re there,” he whispered.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII" class="no-break">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AT THE MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“We’re on some good old fighting ground,” remarked
Henri, who was well versed in history relating
to the country around Château Trouville.
“The Roman legions held forth here centuries ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[87]</span></p>

<p>“They would not have ‘held forth’ any great
while under that German fire the other day.”</p>

<p>Billy was not far wrong on that proposition.</p>

<p>The boys were doing this talking while Reddy
was lighting the lanterns. These lanterns were
bull’s-eyes, and could be turned dark in an instant.</p>

<p>There was no shelling of this spot that night,
for there was not enough of the fort left to make
a target, and the trenches were attracting all the
fire.</p>

<p>The boys could proceed with their work with
some degree of safety.</p>

<p>Reddy painfully located the rocky point by falling
over a big stone in the dark, the boys having
decided to go it blind until they actually had to
use the lights.</p>

<p>“You haven’t broken a leg, have you, Reddy?”
Henri anxiously inquired.</p>

<p>“No, I guess not,” was Reddy’s reply, “but I
think I’ve kicked a toe loose, anyhow.”</p>

<p>The boys switched the masks off their lanterns
and three slender bars of light danced among the
stones.</p>

<p>“Don’t see any cross.”</p>

<p>“Be patient, Billy,” urged Henri, “we haven’t
been here five minutes yet.”</p>

<p>For the next hour the boys circled around the
place without finding a trace of the markings described
in the map.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[88]</span></p>

<p>Billy and Henri sat down to rest, but Reddy,
who seemed never to tire, continued to explore on
his own account. He walked over to the ruins of
the fort, and began to measure, by taking long steps,
on a line some distance from the point where the
boys had been searching for the cross.</p>

<p>Suddenly Reddy stopped. Billy and Henri could
see that the ball of light in his lantern had quit
moving.</p>

<p>“Wonder if he has found anything?” Henri
jumped at the prospect.</p>

<p>“Nothing like going to see,” and Billy with the
words was off like a shot.</p>

<p>Sure enough, Reddy had struck a warm trail.
All of the cross was not under his feet, but there
was sufficient outline to show sections of the original
design. Some of the stones had shifted away,
but there, beyond doubt, was that for which the
boys were looking.</p>

<p>The lantern rays were all directed to the foot
of the outline, that is, the end of the longest row
of bowlders.</p>

<p>The directions had read: “Stone slab at foot of
cross.”</p>

<p>The boys bent to their knees and with faces
close to the earth.</p>

<p>“There’s a corner of it!”</p>

<p>Reddy was making all the discoveries.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri commenced clawing the dirt like<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
hungry chickens. Reddy stood up and used his
feet to better advantage. This combined effort
was rewarded by a clear view of the slab.</p>

<p>It was there, and Billy could not now deny it.</p>

<p>“Remove stone and find iron ring in oak cover.”</p>

<p>But how were the boys to “remove” that stone?
Reddy had a lightning thought. All his thoughts
came that way.</p>

<p>Away he went, chasing the lantern ray ahead of
him. In that heap of crumpled earth and stone,
lately Fort Les Paroches, there was surely something
in the way of iron or steel out of which to
make a stone lifter.</p>

<p>Reddy was back in a few minutes dragging not
only one but two steel bars which had been knocked
like nine-pins from their fastenings.</p>

<p>“Here’s levers for you,” he announced gleefully.</p>

<p>Billy saw what he had, even if he did not understand
what he said.</p>

<p>Henri and Billy with the bar-points punched
holes at the side of the slab and got a purchase.
Then they pried with all their strength. At first
the slab did not budge an inch.</p>

<p>Reddy added his weight to one of the bars and
the slab was loosened in its setting.</p>

<p>“Now another heave!” panted Billy.</p>

<p>“Up she comes!” said Henri.</p>

<p>The slab was lifted high enough to give a chance
for shoulder pressure, and the rest was easy, for<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
when once out of its setting the stone had no great
weight.</p>

<p>The lanterns revealed the fact that the workers
had been rightly directed up to the minute.</p>

<p>The oak cover was there, and also the iron ring.
Through this ring the boys shoved the bars and
pulled the cover away from the opening.</p>

<p>The stone steps were there; somewhat crumbly,
but there. The directions were verified to the
finish.</p>

<p>“Don’t rush in there until you give the fresh
air a chance to go first.”</p>

<p>Reddy knew a lot of things that he had never
learned from books.</p>

<p>But now it was Henri who was getting impatient.</p>

<p>“It ought not to take long for the tunnel to
clear, and, what’s more, we are going to get out
of sight before daylight.”</p>

<p>Daylight was rapidly approaching.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX" class="no-break">CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THROUGH THE SECRET PASSAGE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“It’s me first this time,” declared Henri. “I’m
on the way home, and it’s the duty of this son of
my mother to open the door for our guests.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[91]</span></p>

<p>“You bluffer, you,” said Billy, “what you want
is to take the first risk of going into that hole. I
know you.”</p>

<p>Henri did not stop to argue. He cat-footed it
down the stone steps, holding his lantern in front
of him at arm’s length.</p>

<p>Billy came next, and Reddy last. The last boy,
however, was not the least when it came to thinking.
He thought that it would be a good idea to
fix the oak cover so that he could support it with
his hands and let it drop again over the opening
when the three should have gone underground.</p>

<p>It would give a chance prowler no opportunity
to find the mouth of the tunnel, and either follow
them or set up an alarm that would result in the
boys being caught like rats in a trap.</p>

<p>So Reddy wisely closed the way behind them,
and thus insured that there would be no disturbance
from the rear.</p>

<p>The tunnel route was not an inviting one. The
rounded roof in many places had sagged and closed
in to such an extent as to almost choke the passage,
and great care had to be taken by the boys so as
not to bring a mass of stonework and earth down
upon their heads. This dangerous condition was
chiefly where the tunnel ran through the low
ground, for when the passageway began to ascend
the boys were enabled to go much faster and in
greater safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

<p>But in the tunnel entire the air was stifling and
from the cracks in the slimy walls came hideous
crawling things.</p>

<p>It was fully an hour before the boys had any
assurance that the tunnel really did have an end.</p>

<p>This assurance was a heavily grated door set
in solid masonry.</p>

<p>“Now we are done,” was Billy’s despairing prediction.</p>

<p>“Never say quit; that isn’t like you.”</p>

<p>It was seldom that Henri assumed the rôle of
bracer-up to Billy. It had been generally the other
way, but Billy was willing to acknowledge that
he was not much of a cave man. He liked the open
too well.</p>

<p>There were faint streaks of daylight threading
through the grated spaces of the door. That was
something for which to be thankful.</p>

<p>Reddy was giving the rusty grating a lively shake
when with a clang something hit the stone floor
of the tunnel.</p>

<p>It was a key of the kind that locksmiths used
to make by the pound.</p>

<p>The key had been suspended from a hook at the
side of the door, and Reddy’s vigorous attack on
the grating had caused it to fall.</p>

<p>Henri pushed the key into the ponderous lock
and with a strong-arm twist succeeded in making
it turn. The rusty bolt screeched as it was drawn<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
back, but the door could be opened, and it was
opened by the main pulling strength of three husky
youngsters.</p>

<p>Just on the other side of the door was the rounded
base of a tower, and, looking upward, the sky
could be seen through many openings in the stonework.</p>

<p>There were four doors in this circular room,
the one by which the boys had just entered, and
the other three in a row, close together, directly
opposite the tunnel entrance.</p>

<p>“This,” explained Henri, “is ‘Old Round Tower,’
far more ancient than the château itself, and one
of the landmarks along the Meuse. I never cared
much for it myself as a play place; it was too
gloomy, and rats used to swarm here. I remember
of seeing this door to the tunnel, but always thought
it led to some cellar, and cellars are no novelties
on these grounds. I don’t know how many casks
of wine are underground about here, but there used
to be a big lot.</p>

<p>“This door,” Henri was pointing to the middle
one in the row, “opens on a passage that runs back
of the state dining-hall of the château, and ends
at a panel on the right of the most beautifully
decorated fireplace you ever saw.</p>

<p>“The passages behind the other doors run to
the upper floors of the north and south wings of
the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[94]</span></p>

<p>“There are side connections to them all in the
old part of the château. Of course, in the east
and west wings, added years later, there are no
secret passages nor sliding panels.”</p>

<p>“Which one leads to where the gold and jewels
are kept?”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you in a little while, Billy.”</p>

<p>Henri pushed open the middle door of the row,
and the boys had a whiff of musty tapestry and
other shut-in odors which indicated that the passage
had not been traveled for many a day.</p>

<p>Through the narrow way between the walls the
boys walked, single file, leaving tracks in the dust
and with many a sneeze and gasp.</p>

<p>At a point where the passage widened, Henri
stopped and lifted a finger.</p>

<p>On the other side of the walls there was a
sound of many voices, an occasional peal of laughter,
the clink of glass against glass, and every
now and then merry snatches of song.</p>

<p>Henri felt along the side of the passage until
his fingers touched a little knob about level with
his eyes.</p>

<p>With a slight pressure on the knob a panel on
the other side was controlled and began to slide
noiselessly in polished grooves to the left.</p>

<p>Henri held the movement to an inch.</p>

<p>“Cast your eye in there,” speaking softly to
Billy.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX" class="no-break">CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">BEHIND CHÂTEAU PANELS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The state dining-hall of the château was serving
as the breakfast room of a French general and his
numerous staff. If the uniforms worn had not
indicated to what nation these soldiers belonged,
the proof was surely in the fact that they jested
and sang before breakfast. It takes a gay lot to
be jolly before breakfast. After dinner anybody
might have the notion to be merry.</p>

<p>How Château Trouville had escaped destruction
by the big guns of the Germans might be accounted
for by the fact that the aforesaid big guns had
been mostly employed, when not turned loose on
the trenches, in silencing French barrier forts. As
a German battery lieutenant remarked, “only forts
really counted.”</p>

<p>However it was, this fine French country house
had not even been scratched, as yet.</p>

<p>The chatter in the dining-hall was all Greek
to Billy, though Henri and Reddy appeared to be
much interested and amused by the lively conversation.</p>

<p>Reddy pointed out here and there a chasseur
that he knew by name.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with us having a little<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
breakfast ourselves?” suggested Henri. There was
plenty to eat in the knapsacks.</p>

<p>Billy and Reddy had no protest to make on
this proposition, but they found it thirsty work to
swallow camp rations without even a sup of liquid.</p>

<p>It so happened that a foot soldier serving as
waiter passed close to the wall, carrying a flagon
filled with water. At the moment everybody in
the hall stood up in attitude of salute. The general
was just coming in to breakfast. The soldier
set the flagon down near the panel; Henri pressed
the knob, making the opening wide enough for
Reddy to poke an arm through, and quick as a
flash that expert young gentleman yanked the prize
through the crack, which was instantly closed by
Henri.</p>

<p>The boys could not see what the soldier did
when he discovered his loss, but they imagined
that he must have been considerably surprised by
the mysterious disappearance of the flagon.</p>

<p>The boys had not had a wink of sleep for more
than twenty-four hours, and with all their walking
and the heavy work they had done at “point of
rocks” they were completely fagged.</p>

<p>“Oh, for a good soft place on which to stretch,
and some air that is decent to breathe,” murmured
Billy with nodding head.</p>

<p>“The surest thing I know,” was Henri’s encouraging<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
words to the sleepy-head. “Come on,
fellows.”</p>

<p>Further up the passage Henri pressed another
knob in the wall, and the opening immediately
created let in a veritable blaze of sunlight.</p>

<p>It was a small, narrow room on the other side
of this panel, but spangled with mullioned or barred
windows.</p>

<p>Off this room was another apartment, longer
but no wider than the first. In this latter chamber
stood a gilded bedstead under canopy.</p>

<p>“Here,” said Henri, “royalty was once upon a
time concealed, when it was good for his princely
health to be hidden.”</p>

<p>Billy was more intent on the project of testing
the bed than listening to legends. He mussed up
the rich covering to his liking and rolled like a
log, clothes and all, into the broad expanse under
the canopy. Henri and Reddy with no more ceremony
followed suit, and the three went after the
record of the famous Seven Sleepers.</p>

<p>It was early afternoon when a tremendous clatter
of iron-shod hoofs in the stone courtyard far
below roused Reddy, who always slept with one
ear open.</p>

<p>With no effort to select a favorite, Reddy applied
spanks right and left to his snoring companions.</p>

<p>“Who hit me?” demanded Billy in a dream voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[98]</span></p>

<p>“Where’s the trouble?” Henri was probing the
covers in his haste to reach the inside works of an
imaginary aëroplane motor.</p>

<p>Reddy dragged Henri out of bed by the heels,
and in watching the wrestling match that followed
Billy lost the desire to turn over for just one more
nap.</p>

<p>“You fellows will insult the memory of his royal
nibs if you don’t quit,” he growled.</p>

<p>“There’s evidently something doing below.”</p>

<p>Henri had shaken off the wiry Reddy and
climbed upon one of the window ledges.</p>

<p>It was a cavalry movement, evidently, from the
noise, and movement that indicated hurry orders.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the general won’t be back for dinner.”</p>

<p>The good sleep had put Billy back in his usual
good humor.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what’s up,” admitted Henri, “but
whatever it is I’m thinking that it’s time for us
to get into action before the fighters go to pulling
ears in this vicinity.”</p>

<p>“In other words,” said Billy, “it’s time for us
to pull up the treasure and pull out.”</p>

<p>“That’s the ticket.”</p>

<p>Henri adjusted his knapsack, setting example
for his comrades to get in marching order.</p>

<p>Passing out of the royal bed-chamber, the boys
hastened again into the main passageway, going<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
further north than they had yet been in their flittings
through the concealed walks.</p>

<p>Henri finally stopped over a big brass plate set
in the floor.</p>

<p>“It is not like moving that slab last night,” he
commented, as the plate dropped with a snap on
easy hinges by some combination which Henri well
knew how to work.</p>

<p>A spiral staircase was revealed, and round and
round and ever downward the boys proceeded.</p>

<p>At the foot of the staircase, at the end of a short
passage, the trio were confronted by what was
apparently a blank wall.</p>

<p>Henri counted to himself as he passed his hands
over the face of the wall. When satisfied that
his calculations were correct he called to Billy
to give him a lift. Billy promptly furnished a pair
of square shoulders, upon which Henri stood, after
removing his shoes.</p>

<p>Henri tapped smartly at a selected spot, a hidden
spring was released and a section of the wall fell
away.</p>

<p>Once astride of the cross-piece upon which the
moving section had rested, Henri lent Billy a helping
hand, and Billy in turn gave Reddy, the lightweight,
a stocky leg on which to climb.</p>

<p>The boys then dropped down on the other side.</p>

<p>They were in the treasure house of the Trouvilles!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI" class="no-break">CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">HENRI FINDS THE KEY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The treasure house was a gloomy den of a place,
one small, heavily grated window, with dusty diamond-shaped
panes, set high and deeply in the wall,
like a porthole, being the only means of producing
light from the outside, and even that outside a
dark little court enclosed by frowning walls.</p>

<p>In possession of the safety lanterns, the boys
could be considered lucky, not only to enable them
to quickly complete the task before them, but the
three fire-balls helped wonderfully in relieving the
impression of being locked up in a tomb.</p>

<p>In a far corner of this dungeon was an iron-bound,
oaken box of considerable size, fastened
by a heavy padlock. The discovery of the lock
presented the first difficulty not described in the
paper which Francois had given Henri.</p>

<p>Billy rattled the lock by a vicious jab with the
heel of his shoe, but the effect on link and staple
availed about as much as a feather in a gale. Nothing
short of dynamite, or the right key, could pass
that massive guard.</p>

<p>“Did you think of this?” Billy’s query deserved
top line in the useless question column.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[101]</span></p>

<p>“If I had do you suppose I would be standing
here like a hungry man before a baker’s window?”</p>

<p>Henri was completely bowled over, as the saying
is, by this hitch in his plans, at the eleventh
hour.</p>

<p>Reddy had just completed an unsuccessful assault
on the obstinate padlock when Henri astonished
his friends by doing some tango steps, setting
a lively tune by snapping his fingers.</p>

<p>“Got it, now!” he exclaimed between shuffles.
“Keep on your coats, fellows, I’ll be back in no
time.”</p>

<p>With that the son of the Trouvilles jumped for
the cross-piece in the movable wall section, drew
himself up with the agility of a monkey and with
equal celerity landed in the passage on the other
side of the wall.</p>

<p>The minutes ticked away in Billy’s watch&mdash;ten&mdash;fifteen&mdash;twenty.</p>

<p>No sign of Henri.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand this much longer,” muttered Billy,
never taking his eyes from the hole in the wall
through which Henri had disappeared.</p>

<p>Reddy tried to tell Billy in French that he would
go and hunt for Henri if he (Billy) would not
mind.</p>

<p>Billy did mind. He understood Reddy’s gestures
if he did not fully comprehend the language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[102]</span></p>

<p>“When anybody goes it will be a procession,
with me in the lead.”</p>

<p>He had hardly got this positive assertion out
of his mouth when he heard something scraping
in the passage, followed by the living picture of
Henri framed in the opening above. Then the
familiar voice:</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Buddy.”</p>

<p>“Just when I was thinking it was all wrong.”</p>

<p>Billy lifted his hands to ease Henri’s drop from
the cross-piece, and gave him a bear hug when he
landed.</p>

<p>Henri rapidly gave the reasons for his delay in
getting back.</p>

<p>“You see, a flash of memory brought to my
mind that mother kept the keys to about everything
hanging behind a portrait of father in her bedroom.
I had to go on the other side of the panel to get
there&mdash;it’s in the new part of the house, you know.</p>

<p>“I did not see anybody about when I went
through the fireplace into the dining-hall. You
can wager, though, that I did not lose any time
in dodging through the door to the corridor that
would take me quickest to the place for which
I was bound.</p>

<p>“I got there, all right; found the keys”&mdash;holding
up the jingling bunch dangling from a wire hoop&mdash;“and
was making my grand get-away on the return
trip. As a matter of caution I peeped through<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
the door of the dining-hall before I opened it very
far. Lo and behold our friend from whom Reddy
pilfered the flagon had seated himself at a table
facing the door, through the crack of which I was
straining my eyes.</p>

<p>“This fellow had a bottle of wine at his elbow,
and a glass in his hand. He had settled for a good
time, and I had settled for an uneasy one.</p>

<p>“Directly he arose and walked slowly toward
the fireplace and curiously inspected it. Still wondering
about that missing flagon, I guess. Then
he continued his stroll to the window at the far
end of the hall.</p>

<p>“‘This is the chance for me,’ I thought, and I
bolted for the panel. What if it stuck or wouldn’t
work? Believe me, it was a scary moment. Click,
and I was through. I don’t know whether ‘red
trousers’ saw me or just heard the click of the
panel spring. At any rate, I stopped to listen a
moment, and I heard him tapping here and there
on the oak around the fireplace. That fellow is
sure a suspicious customer.</p>

<p>“Well, here I am, and don’t let us waste any
more time with this talkfest. Turn your lantern
on the padlock, Reddy.”</p>

<p>Henri knelt before the treasure box, holding the
jingling bunch of keys between his eyes and the
blaze of Reddy’s lantern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<p>“That looks like it would fit,” selecting a short
key of heavy turn.</p>

<p>“But it don’t.”</p>

<p>Henri made another selection, with no better
success.</p>

<p>“Try that one,” Reddy pointing to a rusty instrument
in the bunch.</p>

<p>Reddy had hit the nail on the head.</p>

<p>That key turned, and the padlock tumbled into
Henri’s hand.</p>

<p>Then he lifted the lid of the treasure chest!</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII" class="no-break">CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE FORTUNE OF THE TROUVILLES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As the fire-balls flashed upon many velvet-lined
trays displayed by the lifting of the lid, all the
colors of the rainbow seemed to combine in the
dazzling surface&mdash;the white glitter of diamonds,
the violet-purple of amethysts, the blue of the sapphire,
the crimson of the ruby, the deep rich green
of the emerald, the changing tints of the opal&mdash;a
very pool of gems shimmering under the eager gaze
of the three boys.</p>

<p>“Carry me out of fairyland,” was Billy’s break
of the silence that followed the first look into
the chest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[105]</span></p>

<p>Reddy was all eyes and no tongue, but Henri had
to say something in his rôle of showman:</p>

<p>“Some rare stones there, eh? Many years’
gathering, too. This,” picking up a gold-threaded
bracelet of diamonds and amethysts, “is said to
have been a later gift to the house from the royal
gentleman that beat us to the bed upstairs. Whole
lot of history here,” lifting a handful of jewels
and letting them fall again into their glittering
bed, “but we’ll keep all that for the campfire, if
we ever get back to it.</p>

<p>“Here’s some hard cash, by the way,” moving
a jewel tray and pulling out a buckskin bag. “I
am afraid,” added Henri regretfully, “that we can’t
carry a whole lot of this in a single trip where we
have to travel light.”</p>

<p>“We can make a noble try at it,” stoutly maintained
Billy, who did not relish the idea of leaving
anything in the chest.</p>

<p>Henri jerked loose the cord that closed the mouth
of the bag and let the gold coins fall in a shining
heap on the floor&mdash;a mixed collection of franc
pieces of various values, of French minting; English
sovereigns and the German mark.</p>

<p>This shower could have been repeated many
times, for under the trays were long rows of the
same kind of buckskin bags, with contents alike.</p>

<p>“Wish we had a tray.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[106]</span></p>

<p>Billy realized that they had found more than
they could carry.</p>

<p>“We will load first with the stones from the
trays,” proposed Henri. “And then add all the
cash we can.”</p>

<p>The boys proceeded to empty their knapsacks of
the remains of the rations they carried, and by way
of proper economy seated themselves on the stone
floor for the purpose of stowing all the food they
could inside them.</p>

<p>“I won’t be hungry again for a week, I’m sure,”
asserted Billy, shaking the crumbs from his blouse.</p>

<p>“Then let’s to business,” briskly remarked Henri,
as he engaged in the pleasing pastime of stuffing
diamond ornaments into his knapsack. Billy and
Reddy followed the leader in the jewel harvest,
and all three of the knapsacks were soon filled to
capacity and the straps carefully buckled.</p>

<p>That left only pockets, jacket lining and such
space as could be used between clothing and skin
for the coins.</p>

<p>“Remember, fellows,” advised Henri, “that we
mustn’t anchor ourselves, for there is some lively
effort ahead of us.”</p>

<p>Billy was compelled to acknowledge that he was
loaded to the limit at that very moment, and Reddy
certainly carried more weight in his clothes than
he ever had before or ever did afterward.</p>

<p>Shutting down the lid of the chest with a bang,<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
covering again the considerable amount of gold that
the boys were compelled to leave, Henri was about
to announce departure. An afterthought, however,
induced him to lift the lid a second time. He removed
the key of the padlock from the hoop and
tossed the rest of the keys into the chest. Again
closing the lid, he snapped the padlock in place and
slipped the key into the band of his cap.</p>

<p>“Now we’re off.”</p>

<p>“S-sh!”</p>

<p>Billy turned the dark slide in his lantern. Henri
and Reddy followed the cue.</p>

<p>Somebody or something was moving in the passage
on the other side of the wall.</p>

<p>That somebody or something suffered a bump of
some sort or other&mdash;a sound like the overturning
of a chair.</p>

<p>Then a muttered oath in French. The somebody
or something was human, and French.</p>

<p>The boys backed up into the darkest corner of
the treasure house.</p>

<p>The grated window cast only a dim light into the
room, but that line streaked straight across into
the opening in the wall directly opposite.</p>

<p>The head and shoulders of a man appeared in
the opening!</p>

<p>Even in the half-light Henri recognized the soldier
who had lost the flagon and the suspicious<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
tapper on the oak around the fireplace in the dining-hall.</p>

<p>From that panel in the dining-hall to the treasure
house Henri, in his haste, had neglected to close
the other slides, and even the plate over the stairway
behind him.</p>

<p>He had carried a light chair from one of the
upper chambers so that he could get back into the
treasure house without a boost. It was over this
that the trailing chasseur had stumbled, and which
also gave the red-trousered sleuth the very clew
he needed as to the whereabouts of the mysterious
party who had taken the flagon from under his
very heels.</p>

<p>Here was a pretty howdy-do for the boys. A
soldier, and no doubt an armed soldier, between
them and the carrying out of their cherished
project.</p>

<p>There was only one way out of the sealed chamber,
and that soldier was in it.</p>

<p>Could Reddy, the fox of the woods, suggest a
trick that would win here?</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII" class="no-break">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">TRAILED BY A CHASSEUR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The soldier was evidently figuring in his mind
as to what would be the next move on his part.<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
Finding no sign of life in the place where he expected,
no doubt, to lay a hand or an eye on the
impertinent party that had stolen the flagon, the
chasseur seemed to hesitate about dropping down
into what must have appeared to him a dungeon,
and risking the chance of a hidden enemy leaping
upon him from some shadowy corner.</p>

<p>It apparently occurred to him that more light
would clear the problem, for he drew himself up
to a sitting position on the cross-piece, produced
a match and scratched it across the sole of his shoe.</p>

<p>The tiny flicker did not give much satisfaction.
The shadows were too deep for a little flame like
that to penetrate them to any great distance.</p>

<p>The boys stood like statues, flat against the wall,
on the same side, and some twenty feet from the
opening where the soldier was wasting matches.
The darkness hung about them like a pall.</p>

<p>It was one exciting moment when Billy had a
sneeze coming on, and did not know whether or
not he could conquer it. A sneeze just then would
have settled the whole business.</p>

<p>But Billy did not sneeze; he nearly suffocated,
though, by holding his cap so closely against his
face.</p>

<p>The soldier had apparently exhausted his supply
of matches, for the final scratch was accompanied
by a grunt that sounded like <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sacres allumettes</i>,
blasted matches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[110]</span></p>

<p>With that he swung himself down into the passage
on the other side of the opening.</p>

<p>Billy, after a few minutes’ wait, made a move
toward the opening.</p>

<p>Henri laid a restraining hand upon Billy’s arm.</p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” he whispered, “better let Reddy
do his shadow act and find out where our friend
in the red trousers has taken himself.”</p>

<p>Reddy instantly shifted his heavily laden knapsack
from his shoulders, removed his gold-filled
jacket, kicked off his shoes, and edged his way
along the wall on tiptoes.</p>

<p>Under the opening he stood in listening attitude
for several minutes; then, taking advantage of the
rough stonework of the inside wall, he climbed like
a squirrel to the cross-piece.</p>

<p>Cautiously poking his head through the opening,
Reddy had another look and listened for his fellow
countryman in uniform.</p>

<p>The soldier was nowhere to be seen&mdash;and Reddy
could view the short passage as far as the foot of
the spiral staircase, where the light came down from
the open plate above.</p>

<p>Reddy lowered himself into the passage and cat-footed
to the staircase, winding his way upward,
every nerve on edge, and he ready for any emergency.</p>

<p>The soldier was not in evidence yet, but Reddy
could now trace the chasseur by the marks on the<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
dusty floor of the passage, for it was still light up
here, though the sun, it could be seen through the
panel opening in the royal bed chamber, was sinking,
and evening was near.</p>

<p>With eyes to the floor and crouched like an Indian
trailer, the boy noted that the chasseur had
gone toward the panel opening into the dining-hall,
at least the traces showed that the footmarks reversed
themselves, retracing in the same direction.
Reddy could distinguish the soldier’s tracks from
those which he and his companions had made that
morning, because the legging strap under the man’s
shoes was clearly outlined in the dust.</p>

<p>Reddy, seeing that the coast was clear, for the
time being, scooted back to where Henri and Billy
were anxiously waiting and called them by name.
Reddy’s knapsack, jacket, and shoes fell about him
in the passage, speedily followed by the two boys.
Henri stood on the chair and closed the wall section,
which settled back without leaving a seam or mark
on the wall surface.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet they won’t find that hole unless they
batter down the whole wall,” was Henri’s comment.</p>

<p>The boys lost no time in getting upstairs and into
the main passage, and there paused to give Henri
a moment to figure the next move.</p>

<p>It was suddenly made manifest that at least one<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
way was blocked, for loud voices rang out in the
passage in the direction of the dining-hall.</p>

<p>The chasseur had gone for assistance to aid him
in solving the puzzle that he had at first wanted
to solve by himself.</p>

<p>Billy and Reddy thought that this time sure they
were done for, but Henri was still in the reckoning.
He was at home, and knew every crook and
cranny in the maze of passages.</p>

<p>As the soldiers approached nearer and nearer,
arguing in rapid-fire French as they came, Henri
wheeled, slammed the bedroom panel into place,
and hustling his companions into a run retreated
up the passage to the north, stopping an instant to
close the plate over the staircase.</p>

<p>“That fellow will have to do some tall explaining
when he comes up with his crowd, for he won’t
be able to show all that he may claim to have seen;
that is, for a while, anyway.”</p>

<p>Henri was taking a positive dislike to the soldier
who had proved such a bother at this critical period.</p>

<p>At the very end of the passage they were traversing
arose a stained glass window of most exquisite
design. On each side of the window the
wainscoting was inlay work, model of ancient arts
and crafts.</p>

<p>Henri used his hands on this surface as he would
finger a checker or chess board. A large square
swung open like a cupboard door and Henri motioned<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
his comrades to pass through, and he, at
their heels, closed the panel.</p>

<p>They stood in a narrow gallery, looking down
into a chapel interior, most beautiful to behold.
Hurrying along this gallery, the boys halted at a
door heavily mounted with brass fittings. It was
opened without effort and the boys found themselves
at the head of another of those steep stairways,
this one, however, running straight down&mdash;and
a long way down.</p>

<p>It led to the crypt, or subterranean vault, under
the chapel. Here the boys lighted their lanterns,
at the suggestion of Henri. The latter shouldered
a protruding stone in the wall of the cell and it
gave way, disclosing of all the passages they had
encountered in the house the most dismal and forbidding.</p>

<p>“Push in,” said Henri, “and we’re on the way to
‘Old Round Tower!’”</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV" class="no-break">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A RACE FOR LIFE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Gee! But isn’t this a jolly place, if you don’t
care what you say.”</p>

<p>A rat almost as big as a small rabbit had made
a dash over Billy’s feet. He also had just dodged
a bat that had flapped straight at his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[114]</span></p>

<p>“You’re a good way underground, my boy,”
said Henri, “and I guess it’s been many a day
since anybody hit this trail. It is called ‘Monk’s
Walk.’ Jules, Francois and myself explored this
passage one day when we didn’t have anything else
to do, but had no desire to do it more than once.
Our old butler, he was ninety when he died, showed
us how to get in here, and he had a long story to
tell about a hair-raising happening here a century
ago. But that’s another thing that will keep for
the campfire.”</p>

<p>The journey through this rat and bat infested
passage seemed an age in the making. The floor
was damp and slippery and each of the boys had
a fall, but, happily, without injury.</p>

<p>It was really less than half an hour that was
consumed in going from the crypt of the chapel to
the door opening into “Old Round Tower,” but
Billy declared that he was much older when he
got there than when he started.</p>

<p>“‘It’s dead for sleep I am,’ as Mike said,” further
declared the boy from Bangor, “and I’ll bet it’s
past midnight this very minute. Twenty minutes
of, anyhow,” looking at his watch. “And hasn’t
this been a day and a half for full measure? Something
doing every minute.”</p>

<p>Reddy felt the same way, but there was no use
telling Billy so, because Billy did not take kindly
to the French language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[115]</span></p>

<p>Henri himself, if the truth be known, was fighting
to keep his eyes open.</p>

<p>So on the bottom floor of “Old Round Tower”
the boys stretched themselves, and with knapsack
pillows as hard as the floor itself they dozed into
uneasy slumber, which lasted until the dawn of a
new day.</p>

<p>The sleepers were startled by the roar of cannon.
Not that the roar of cannon was unusual to
these now veterans in the ways of war, but the
booming seemed particularly close this morning,
and in a locality that had, as stated before in this
chronicle, heretofore escaped shelling.</p>

<p>“I thought that French general had gone to seek
trouble when the whole push galloped away yesterday,”
was Billy’s first after-waking remark.</p>

<p>“Pity they hadn’t taken that dining-hall chasseur
with them.”</p>

<p>Henri in this moment of alarm, had a thought
for the busybody who had tracked them from pillar
to post a few hours ago.</p>

<p>A shell landed with tremendous explosion in the
courtyard of the château; another, and another,
until the whole place was shaken in every foundation,
the air was aflame with the shrieking projectiles,
and crash after crash made a din that was
deafening.</p>

<p>“Us for the tunnel!” cried Henri, as a round-shot<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
clipped the side of the tower above them and
sent down a hail of stone chips.</p>

<p>The boys got out from under that tower in a
hurry, and fortunate for them that they did. Two
or three minutes later the whole structure collapsed
under the terrific impact of the shelling.</p>

<p>When the trio ran through the tunnel door, it
was sealed behind them by tons of riven stone.</p>

<p>Pale to the lips and trembling as if with acute
ague, the boys weakly stumbled down the tunnel’s
descending course.</p>

<p>The earth above and about them quaked and
shivered as the storm of powder and lead raged
outside.</p>

<p>The same powerful engines of destruction that
had blasted and silenced the French barrier forts
had been turned on the château and its surroundings.
Such buildings were as paper before this
cannonading.</p>

<p>The walls of the tunnel were holding as far as
the boys had proceeded. But they had yet to traverse
the line in low ground, where they had noted,
in coming, the sagging roof and leaning walls, which
even then had almost choked up the passage.</p>

<p>With these conditions made worse by the artillery
shake-up, it would be a close call if the boys
escaped burial alive. There was no way out at
the rear.</p>

<p>A shut off ahead&mdash;and that would be the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[117]</span></p>

<p>But for the lanterns it is doubtful if the boys
could have refrained from running wild, and dashing
into obstructions without care or reason.</p>

<p>They at least did not have the added horror of
total darkness with which to contend.</p>

<p>As the descent grew sharper so grew the nerve
strain of the travelers.</p>

<p>They passed the first point of danger on hands
and knees. Between the roof and the floor there
was the scant margin of three feet.</p>

<p>At the next the barrier presented an even tighter
squeeze.</p>

<p>Then a clearer way for ten or fifteen yards.</p>

<p>Here it was that the lantern shafts of light ahead
showed in one appalling instant a shifting of earth;
first dust, then clods and small stones.</p>

<p>The passage was closing in!</p>

<p>The boys stood for a second as if petrified in their
tracks.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pour vos vies, courez!</i> (for your lives, run!)</p>

<p>Reddy’s shrill voice broke the spell, and the three
dashed for the fast closing aperture. Billy, in the
lead, essayed to step aside and let the others get
through first, but Henri countered the movement
with a violent push against the back of his friend
and a reach for Reddy’s neck&mdash;the one boy he
pushed through and the other he dragged, himself
falling, full length, on his face, but safe on the
other side of the death trap!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>None too soon, for Henri’s legs were powdered
with the dust from the earth mass that had fallen
in a lump just behind him!</p>

<p>“Glory be!”</p>

<p>Billy said it with more fervency than ever before.</p>

<p>“Glory be!”</p>

<p>He said it again with grateful heart.</p>

<p>They were on the gradual ascent, and finally
rested under the slab that would let them out into
the free air.</p>

<p>No matter what they might be called upon to
face there&mdash;it would be in the open.</p>

<p>Glory be!</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV" class="no-break">CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE SERGEANT TO THE RESCUE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“There’s nothing to do but lie here until nightfall,”
said Henri. “A try for camp now would be
almost a sure shot that we would be gobbled up.
They’re fighting all around us.”</p>

<p>“Held up, you mean, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Billy could see only one fate for walking jewelry
shops.</p>

<p>Reddy was in favor of a night move. He favored
darkness for this kind of adventure, except in
tunnels. He told Henri that if given half a chance
he (Reddy) could get them back to their friends<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
with the same ease that he had conducted the excursion
to the mouth of the tunnel.</p>

<p>“Billy mustn’t step on any sticks, though,” he
added with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>Billy knew that his name had mixed in the conversation,
but he was not sure just what the little
Frenchman was joking about. Besides, he was too
thirsty to care.</p>

<p>“My throat is as dry as a bone,” he complained.</p>

<p>“I’m a little husky myself,” admitted Henri, “and
wouldn’t mind spending a few franc pieces for a
pitcher of lemonade”&mdash;jingling the gold in his
pockets.</p>

<p>“That reminds me,” he continued, “that I’m
thinking that it would be a good plan to bury this
stuff right where we are. There is no telling what
kind of a chase we will have getting back to camp,
and it would be rough luck to chance losing that
for which we have risked so much.”</p>

<p>“But that means another trip here,” argued
Billy, “and it’s me for one with no wish to haunt
this territory.”</p>

<p>Reddy turned a torrent of French loose on Henri.</p>

<p>“He says,” Henri translating to Billy, “that to-night
he will take to the woods alone, reach Colonel
Bainbridge and tell him of our troubles, and it may
be that sufficient force could be sent to pull us
lambkins and the treasure out of the hole.”</p>

<p>“Bet the colonel will do it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[120]</span></p>

<p>Billy enthusiastically approved the scheme.</p>

<p>“Come to think of it, though,” he amended, “if
it isn’t unfair to Reddy I think it is a great idea.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about Reddy,” assured Henri,
“he is better off around here without us than we
would be without him.”</p>

<p>“Then the only thing on my mind now is one big
drink of cold water.” Billy drew a long breath at
the thought.</p>

<p>But thirst and hunger the boys must endure for
a while; they dared not risk all until actually forced
to do so.</p>

<p>Billy looked at his watch at least twenty times
that afternoon. He was not quite sure that it was
right, for the little silver ticker had been badly
dented during the struggle for life in the tunnel,
but the works were still merrily moving, and so
continued worthy of confidence.</p>

<p>The watch, on the twentieth inspection, showed
seven o’clock. The time for Reddy’s departure
was drawing nigh.</p>

<p>No longer a rich prize for would-be captors,
Reddy put himself in trim for swift and silent
mission. His jewel-laden knapsack he laid aside.
He shed gold, indeed, from every pore, and stood
erect and smiling, as poor in purse as when he
fled from his ruined home into the hills.</p>

<p>The watch ticked away another hour. Then
Reddy was hoisted aloft on Billy’s shoulders, and<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
turned the palms of his hands upward against the
slab. A vigorous shove that almost cost Reddy his
balance raised the stone and turned it to one side.
Reddy did not fall backward, he leaped upward,
dug his elbows into the earth, and wriggled out
upon solid ground.</p>

<p>Pushing the slab back into place, and without
another word, he bounded away in the darkness
toward the familiar path in the ravine.</p>

<p>Nine&mdash;ten&mdash;eleven&mdash;midnight were counted by
Billy’s watch.</p>

<p>After that the two comrades ceased to mark time.
They were too drowsy to mark anything.</p>

<p>They would not have attempted to resist a rat
had one attacked them.</p>

<p>There was coming from the tier of hills, from the
terraced slopes rising above the valley of the Meuse,
armed aid, but of the good tidings there was yet
no sign to the weary, hungry, thirsty boys in the
far-off cave.</p>

<p>Reddy had gone straight as a homing pigeon to
the army headquarters, had pleaded his way through
every sentry post, and to the presence of Colonel
Bainbridge.</p>

<p>The mainspring of the military machinery was
quick to act, and it was a gallant array that the little
red-headed Frenchman guided to the rescue of
the treasure guards he had left in the tunnel.</p>

<p>There was yet a bayonet charge to be resisted<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
before the slab was lifted. There had been fierce
combat, hand-to-hand, as well as artillery practice
at Château Trouville. A company in gray had
fallen back from the main body in the night in the
direction of the ruined fort. The rescue party
came as a surprise out of the ravine, and “point
of rocks” was made the scene of a brief but desperate
encounter. The German force, outnumbered,
gave way.</p>

<p>Reddy, who had been viewing the clash from
behind a screen of stones, jumped from the slab
when danger had ceased to threaten, and in his
excitement plumped down into the pit like a football.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri, now very much awake, were
jointly seized by the hands, and Reddy, who had
alighted flat-footed, pulled his comrades about in a
sort of circular war dance.</p>

<p>This came to a sudden stop when a deep, commanding
voice hurled these words downward:</p>

<p>“You kids come up and report!”</p>

<p>The speaker was Sergeant Scott.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI" class="no-break">CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ORDERS TO MOVE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Reddy having resumed his share of the burden
of precious stones and gold pieces, the three boys
were given, in turn, the glad hand and a stout pull
out of the pit. The sergeant tried his best to maintain
a severe manner, but the effort proved a rank
failure. The delight of the big trooper over the
finding and assured safety of his young charges
would not down. Even the natural and cultivated
reserve of the Englishman was not proof against
the affectionate regard he felt for the boys he had
both fathered and mothered for these many days.</p>

<p>As the rescue party marched on either side of
the sergeant, striving to match his long step, walked
Billy and Henri, with Reddy close in the rear.</p>

<p>“You got me in a pretty mess with the colonel,
you little rascals.”</p>

<p>“Well, we just had to do it, Sergeant,” answered
Henri. “It’s what we came for, and you can’t blame
us for not throwing away our last chance to win
out. It was for sure our last chance, for Château
Trouville is no more.”</p>

<p>There was a note of sadness in the last sentence.
It was of great sorrow to Henri that this beautiful
home place had been reduced to a smoking ruin,<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
with its priceless works of art and all those heirlooms
so dear to the hearts of the race of Trouville.</p>

<p>All that remained of the family fortune had been
saved by Henri and his faithful boy friends at the
risk of their lives.</p>

<p>Saved? Many a league to travel, before the
treasure reached its fixed destination, many a slip
to be avoided, many a sharp corner to be bravely
turned.</p>

<p>“We thank you with all our hearts, sir.”</p>

<p>The boys were greeting Colonel Bainbridge, and
each was favored by that officer with a warm handshake.</p>

<p>“Away with you now,” ordered the colonel. “Get
food and rest. To-morrow I have new plans for
you. Leave your knapsacks in yonder tent, over
which a guard will be mounted.”</p>

<p>The boys thought that no place had ever appeared
so attractive as the field kitchen, with its soup boiler
and its oven on wheels. And the cooks were more
than kind. It was well known that the colonel had
favored attention to his young friends.</p>

<p>Relieved of hunger and thirst the boys hunted
up their old friend, the teamster, and he provided
them with blankets and a comfortable nest under
cover of a supply wagon.</p>

<p>The next morning the boys expected an after-breakfast
summons from the colonel, but there was<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
no call for them from headquarters. Fierce fighting
was going on in the valley town of St. Mihiel,
on the right bank of the Meuse, and, in viewing
the conflict from the hillside point, the boys were
thrilled by a moving picture that would have commanded
a fortune in the films.</p>

<p>The town on which the war plague had fallen is
on the site of the ancient Abbey of St. Mihiel, and
the tide of this day’s battle surged about the noted
Church of St. Mihiel, containing that fine statue of
the Madonna, by the great artist, Richier, and also
the choir stalls world-famed for their beauty.</p>

<p>Henri and Reddy took it as a personal grievance
that these things should be threatened with destruction.</p>

<p>“I’ll just tell you what,” suddenly declared Billy,
breaking a long silence on his part, “I’d like to be
the aviator who makes the first flight across the
Atlantic, and especially if I could start to-day from
this side!”</p>

<p>“And leave me, Billy?”</p>

<p>Henri had applied the tonic that Billy needed.</p>

<p>“Not this day, or ever, Buddy. It was only this
war business that set me dreaming of better days.
On to Paris, old chum, you and I!”</p>

<p>Billy was himself again.</p>

<p>Turning back to camp, the boys were informed
that the colonel had given the word that they were
to report to him as soon as they could be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[126]</span></p>

<p>“Something’s up,” predicted Billy, as they hurried
to headquarters.</p>

<p>The colonel, when they arrived, was busy poring
over an outspread map, and occasionally conferring
with other officers grouped about him.</p>

<p>It was some time before the boys received attention,
for evidently some issue of considerable moment
was under discussion.</p>

<p>When the colonel finally expressed himself satisfied
with the program outlined, he turned to his
young friends and remarked:</p>

<p>“I presume that you will not object to my making
a change of base, and,” smiling, “I hope you will
not deny me the honor of your company in the
movement.”</p>

<p>“Always at your command, colonel,” gallantly
responded Henri.</p>

<p>“Then,” concluded the colonel, “you will be advised
shortly of the hour of marching.”</p>

<p>“What’s to become of me?”</p>

<p>This was the anxious question that Reddy addressed
to Henri as they left headquarters.</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose that we’re going to lose you
this side of Paris, do you?” was Henri’s prompt
counter question.</p>

<p>“Paris!” joyfully echoed the boy. “Me? Let’s
hurry!”</p>

<p>Billy guessed that Reddy was glad.</p>

<p>“I don’t know where I’m going, but I’m on the<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
way,” hummed the boy from Bangor, as they
hastened to tell the teamster the good news.</p>

<p>An hour later the sergeant came down to the
wagon. As usual, he spoke to the point:</p>

<p>“Get your bundles, boys!”</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVII" class="no-break">CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE BOYS GO GUN HUNTING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The French had been massing their troops by
forest paths, from Verdun and Toul, to throw them
against the Germans in desperate endeavors to
break the lines which protected the sites for the
German heavy siege artillery and the Austrian automobile
batteries of twelve-inch siege guns.</p>

<p>To join in this movement the command of Colonel
Bainbridge was preparing.</p>

<p>For days the French aviators had repeatedly scrutinized
every acre of land looking for a concealed
battery of growlers, snugly hidden in a wood on
the rolling heights of the Cote Lorraine. These
aviators had failed to mark a find.</p>

<p>The conference that the boys had witnessed at
headquarters, when summoned by Colonel Bainbridge,
had to do with this battery problem. They
had then heard mention of the doings and failure<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
of the flying corps, but further had not been taken
into the confidence of the officers.</p>

<p>When the sergeant directed them to get their
bundles, Billy and Henri began to hope that they
might run into an opportunity to once again get
near a flying-machine, if not into one.</p>

<p>“I’d like to get above ground once more, for sure
I’ve had enough underground work lately to last me
a lifetime.”</p>

<p>The desire of Billy to do some lofty sailing was
twin with the wish that haunted Henri.</p>

<p>“Let’s volunteer to scout for that battery,” urged
the latter, aroused by his chum’s suggestion.</p>

<p>“No use,” was Billy’s discouraging reply. “The
colonel won’t stand for it.”</p>

<p>“But, maybe he would, after all,” reasoned Henri,
“if we put it up to him the right way. His own
son was in that branch of the service.”</p>

<p>“If you can convince the colonel, well and good.”</p>

<p>Billy appeared to think that there was a conspiracy
afloat to keep him tied fast to the ground.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make the try,” said Henri, “as
soon as we join the other force.”</p>

<p>He did make the try next day, and finally persuaded
the colonel that under the constant battery
fire Billy and himself would be at least as safe in
the air as on the march.</p>

<p>“Just think, colonel, what a chance for us to do
something worth while, and do it the only way we<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
can. As soldiers we don’t count. As aviators
we’re the lucky number.”</p>

<p>When the French commander heard that one
of our Aviator Boys had an idea that his eyes were
better than those of the military flyers, he amusedly
assented to the proposition, but only because of the
fact that there was a shortage just then in the aviation
corps&mdash;two of them only the day before having
sailed in the way of a shell from one of the big
mortars of the enemy.</p>

<p>“It’s our job!”</p>

<p>This was the joyful announcement of Henri to
his flying partner.</p>

<p>The next argument was with the sergeant, but
he, too, was compelled to throw up his hands in
surrender.</p>

<p>The French aviator who directed the corps told
Henri that their detail was for “artillery reconnaissance.”</p>

<p>When Henri translated the name of their job to
Billy, the latter said that “gun hunting” would serve
just as well, and it could be spoken in one breath.
“I haven’t enlisted on either side, mind you,” added
Billy. “I am just aching to fly&mdash;that’s all.”</p>

<p>The French outfit included a machine “built for
two,” and of a make with which the boys were
familiar.</p>

<p>The only instructions given the amateur scouts
related to the direction of the mysterious shelling<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
point from which so much damage had been inflicted
upon the Allies without an open chance to
retaliate.</p>

<p>For the treasure the colonel had agreed to act as
banker, and, as a balm to Reddy’s wounded feelings,
when he rebelled at separation from his friends, that
youngster was assigned to duty as special messenger
within the lines.</p>

<p>Again our Aviator Boys listened to the vibration
of the aëroplane, the rattle, roar and hum of the
motor, the music that soothes the nerves of every
practiced airman.</p>

<p>The boys hit the high grade at 8,000 feet, and
circled in huge ellipses between the allied troops
and the positions hostile to them.</p>

<p>Henri had been given a powerful field glass, and
he was faithfully using it in acute observation. The
roar of the aërial travel was so loud in the quiet
of the upper air that it drowned the occasional
thunder of the big guns, which fire could be marked
by sight if not by hearing.</p>

<p>A few moments of sweeping flight, and the young
aviators were looking down on the wood mapped
as suspicious.</p>

<p>They hovered about, while Henri worked the
field glasses to the limit, but to no avail.</p>

<p>“Let her down a bit!” he yelled to Billy.</p>

<p>Billy cut the height a thousand feet or so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[131]</span></p>

<p>Nothing but tree-tops was in sight.</p>

<p>“More yet!” shouted Henri.</p>

<p>Dangerously near now, if there was a hidden
battery below.</p>

<p>Henri bent further over the frame of the machine,
with the glasses aimed at a certain point,
which had suddenly become of special interest to
him. He had seen something that was not a tree-top.</p>

<p>The glasses revealed the location of the battery.
The guns, two in this particular position, stood
behind a screen of thickly branching trees, the
muzzles pointing toward a round opening in this
leafy roof. The crew as suddenly discovered their
visitors, and instantly, as busy as bees, sprang to
their posts.</p>

<p>“Turn her loose!” screamed Henri in Billy’s ear,
and Billy did “turn her loose,” up and away.</p>

<p>The gunners were not quick enough to catch this
winged target, but they burned a couple of large
holes in the air in trying.</p>

<p>Billy drove the aëroplane into a protecting cloud
that closed white and moist around them.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later the excited flyers told their
story to the colonel.</p>

<p>“That ride was a bully treat,” declared Billy;
“but really I’d like to have stopped in a chummy
way with those fellows on the hill long enough to<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
see them work the guns. They’re some hustlers
with the big irons, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“Next time you can send in your card,” laughed
Henri.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII" class="no-break">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">GOOD NEWS FROM DOVER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The bombardment of Rheims was in full blast,
and here it was that the boys witnessed a strange
combination of war and peace. Unaffected by the
terrific shelling of the town, refugees from Northern
France and Belgium were busy in the country
picking grapes for the French champagne yield.</p>

<p>“Can you match that?”</p>

<p>Billy marveled at the scene presented.</p>

<p>Henri and Reddy were intently watching the
flight of shells, some of which struck the cathedral,
and a boy bugler, between 14 and 15 years old,
who came out of the heat of the fray, told them
that a shell had fallen on one of the high altars
and had considerably damaged it.</p>

<p>This youngster had the grit, for he was as cool
as a cucumber under fire, and with his battalion
had been nearly all day where bullets flew thicker
than flies in Egypt.</p>

<p>“That was quite a shake-up,” referring to the
shell explosion in the cathedral, “but,” assuming<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
the easy air of one accustomed to such things, “it
wasn’t a marker to some of the whacks I’ve seen
coming from those howitzers.</p>

<p>“I’m from Dover; name Stetson; came over with
the marine brigade; from where does your ticket
read?”</p>

<p>The youthful bugler was looking at Billy.</p>

<p>“From Bangor, Maine, United States of America;
Barry is the family handle, and the front name
is Billy.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stetson, I’ll have you know Mr. Henri
Trouville and Mr. Joseph Mouselle, I think that is
the way you pronounce it, isn’t it, Reddy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, call me Jimmy,” jovially urged the newcomer;
“what’s ‘misters’ between friends?”</p>

<p>“Did you know Capt. Leonidas Johnson and Mr.
Josiah Freeman in Dover?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“Did I know them?” cried Jimmy. “Did I know
the town-clock and the wharves? They’re the
flying machine men, and I have hung around their
hangars so much that I must have worn out my
welcome. To tell the truth, though, I am on the
waver between an aëroplane and a submarine. I’ve
have had some training, too, in the underwater
boats. Say, coming back at you, do you know
Capt. Johnson, or just heard of him?”</p>

<p>“Rather well acquainted with him, I should
imagine,” stated Billy with a smile; “Henri and I
rode up here in the captain’s seaplane.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[134]</span></p>

<p>“Gee whiz, then, you’re the Aviator Boys I have
heard about. I was in London when that happened,
and when I came back to Dover to say farewell
to mother I had no more than time to wave
a hand to the captain before the ship sailed for
Ostend.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that Captain Johnson and
Josh Freeman are in Dover?” was Billy’s excited
query.</p>

<p>“Just so,” stoutly maintained Jimmy. “I saw
them with my own eyes.”</p>

<p>“Glory be!” Billy was happiest when he said
that.</p>

<p>“Hear that, Henri, old boy? Capt. Johnson
and Freeman are safe in Dover.”</p>

<p>Billy could not help repeating the glad tidings.</p>

<p>“Wonder how they got away?”</p>

<p>Henri would have been mightily pleased to talk
it over with the old boys that very minute.</p>

<p>Billy had already added Jimmy to his good friend
list, and these two kept up a running fire of questions
aimed at one another.</p>

<p>Aëroplanes and submarines were dissected and
put together again many times during the lively
conversation.</p>

<p>“How did you get so far from the water? You
ought to be blowing a fog-horn instead of a bugle,
Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, Billy,” replied Jimmy, “that it was<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
just a fluke that I got anywhere outside of prisoners’
quarters. They picked up a bunch of us
at Nieuport, and one of the German officers asked
me if I had run away from school. The fact that
they classed me kindergarten furnished me the
chance of skipping, and I starved my way to the
camp of the Coldstream Guards. They were going
my way or I was going theirs, and here I am.”</p>

<p>The boys had a reminder about that time that
a war was going on, for chunks of lead began to
purr over the exposed position where they were
grouped.</p>

<p>“Blow a retreat,” suggested Henri to the bugler;
but none of them waited for that signal to get to
cover.</p>

<p>So great had grown their confidence in the new
friend that Henri and Billy at mess that evening
jointly gave him details of their adventures in
the château and the tunnel, and even told about
the treasure they were carrying.</p>

<p>Jimmy was an eager listener, and as the tale
unfolded, his admiration for the prowess of his
new comrades reached the top degree.</p>

<p>“I’ve joined the band,” he insisted earnestly,
“and I’m going to see you through. Count me in
from date.”</p>

<p>“If we only had Leon with us now,” laughed
Henri, “we could push over an army.”</p>

<p>“You bet Leon was a good one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[136]</span></p>

<p>Billy had more than once declared that if he
ever got near to a place where they stocked Christmas
ships there would be something special in the
cargo for the little Belgian.</p>

<p>When the sergeant roll-called the boys, as usual,
that night he was requested to include Jimmy.</p>

<p>“If I adopt a few more of you,” he grumbled,
“I’ll be fit for the presidency of Bedlam.”</p>

<p>But the sergeant’s bark was far worse than
his bite.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIX" class="no-break">CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">SAVED THE DAY!</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The shifting tide of battle had forced the advanced
line of the Allies to contend with a strong
forward movement of German troops. In the
shelter of a wonderfully ingenious and deep-dug
trench the boys looked out upon a bloody battlefield,
one of the bloodiest in European history.</p>

<p>French soldiers with rifles in their hands, standing
or kneeling in the immediate vicinity, keenly
peered over the flat land toward the positions
known to be held by the Germans, concealed in
the woods&mdash;forests believed to be bristling with
machine guns, backed by infantry in rifle pits and
covered trenches.</p>

<p>Time and again the French infantry had found<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
these positions impossible of taking owing to
barbed wire entanglements strewn with brush and
branches of trees.</p>

<p>A heavy siege gun supporting the Allies was
in action at the time. A French artilleryman with
the hand elevating gear rapidly cranked the big
barrel down to a level position ready for loading.
A second threw open the breech and extracted the
brass cartridge case, carefully wiping it out before
depositing it among the empties; four more seized
the heavy shell and lifted it to a cradle opposite
the breech; a seventh rammed it home; number
eight gingerly inserted the brass cartridge, half
filled with vaseline-like explosive; the breech was
closed, and the gun pointer rapidly cranked the
gun into position again. In less than thirty seconds
the men sprang back from the gun, again
loaded and aimed. The mortar sent its shell purring
through the air against a German position
on a far-off hill. There was an answering burst
of flame from the enemy’s battery. Both shots
were too high. With this incessant trying for
range, the sharp whirring sounds in the air seemed
almost continuous. And there were hits that
pierced ramparts of flesh and blood!</p>

<p>Groups of wounded passed without ceasing, and
yet the conflict was ever renewed with death-defying
courage. The command to which the boys
were attached had been driven from their entrenchment<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
by literal showers of shells, and fell
back to the headquarters of yesterday.</p>

<p>They were threatened from all sides with annihilation,
hemmed in by walls of steel and sheets
of flame, on three sides by bayonets, and on the
other by blazing batteries.</p>

<p>The left wing of the Allies was in desperate
encounter also and unable to effect a junction with
and relieve the tremendous pressure on the right.</p>

<p>Twenty-five miles away were stationed troops
of cavalrymen standing at the heads of their chargers,
ready to jump into the saddle at a moment’s
call and stem any torrent of infantry that came
their way. These cavalrymen had been so held
in reserve by the Allies, because of the burrowing
campaign that had been conducted in the immediate
vicinity of the battlefield. But now that
the fighting had burst the confines of the trenches
they were sorely needed.</p>

<p>There was one way only to summon the reserves
in time, so desperate was the situation. That
was by aëroplane. But two machines of the French
command had escaped destruction, and but one
man of the aviation corps out of six who was not
among the missing, wounded or killed.</p>

<p>This survivor, eager to serve, was ordered into
his aëroplane and the machine hurtled aloft. The
flyer made a fearless attempt to cross the field at
a height of a quarter of a mile. Bullets from<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
guns mounted on top of a slope pierced the aëroplane’s
gasoline tank, causing the fuel to escape
and forcing the pilot to attempt to glide to the
earth. On reaching the ground he tried to defend
himself with a revolver, but was quickly
captured.</p>

<p>The French commander, at the sight, shrugged
his shoulders, and with a despairing gesture turned
to Colonel Bainbridge, with the words:</p>

<p>“It is all over.”</p>

<p>Henri heard the remark, and in wild excitement
fairly leaped toward the officers.</p>

<p>“There’s another machine, and two of us left
who know how to run it. We’re ready!”</p>

<p>The French officer recognized the speaker as one
of the boys who had located the German battery
when his own aviators had failed to make a find.</p>

<p>“What do you think of it?” he asked Colonel
Bainbridge.</p>

<p>“I think that they can save the day,” solemnly
asserted the officer addressed.</p>

<p>“To the front, Billy!” loudly called Henri.</p>

<p>Billy was already “to the front”&mdash;he was testing
the machine in preparation for instant flight.</p>

<p>Jimmy and Reddy were there with the shove
that started the aëroplane rolling; our Aviator Boys
were in their places, and away they went. They
did not risk any low flight to attract high range<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
guns, but streaked for the clouds from the very
start.</p>

<p>Like an arrow, but even speedier, they moved a
mile a minute, and, descending, displayed the
French colors to check a chance shot from some
enterprising cavalryman.</p>

<p>The message delivered, there was a great ado
about boots and saddles, and the mounted troops
galloped like mad toward the scene of action.</p>

<p>Again rising high, the boys slackened pace that
they might watch the progress of the cavalry below,
for as swiftly as these seasoned horses might
traverse the distance, they were as snails to an aëroplane.</p>

<p>The flyers saw the cavalrymen hurl themselves
into the conflict on the plain, and saw men and
charging horses go down here and there, and infantrymen
everywhere under furious onslaught.</p>

<p>So formidable was the attack of the fresh troops
that they won their way to the position where their
surrounded comrades were making what they
thought to be their last stand against overwhelming
odds.</p>

<p>It was, though, at fearful cost, through a bloody
lane, and over ground strewn with dead and
wounded.</p>

<p>The young airmen themselves had a close call
before completing their hazardous journey; a bullet
struck the machine, causing it to lurch as though<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
reeling from a blow, and Billy had to throw the
wheel hard around to prevent the aëroplane from
rolling right over upon its side.</p>

<p>But, diving and swerving, the good craft swept
down, while the relief and the relieved regiments
rent the air with cheers.</p>

<p>Our Aviator Boys had saved the day!</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">SETTING OUT FOR THE SEA.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Verdun to Mezieres, near the historic field of
Sedan; Dinant, Namur&mdash;names of everyday reading
now, on the northern army route to Brussels.
Colonel Bainbridge, Sergeant Scott, the Boy Aviators,
Jimmy and Reddy were all in the march for
the coast region. The Trouville jewels and gold
had been sewn into four canvas belts, and one assigned
to each of the boys, who wore them under
their blouses. It was the intention of Henri and
his young comrades to accompany the command
until it reached the vicinity of some near coast
point, where they planned to try for a ship voyage
that would end in the English Channel.</p>

<p>Jimmy had no military ties to hold him with
the Coldstream Guards; he was a waif until he
found his own command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[142]</span></p>

<p>“Give me even a day on the old stamping
grounds,” he said, “and it’s me that will be a jolly
boy.”</p>

<p>“Wish there was a bridge over the briny deep,”
chimed in Billy, “and I know somebody who would
soon start on the long walk to Bangor.”</p>

<p>Henri was thinking of his mother, and Reddy
was never out of his dream of Paris.</p>

<p>West Flanders was the scene of incessant military
operations, and like an island was cut off from
the rest of Belgium, through the blowing up of
the bridges leading thereto. Peasants were obliged
to make emergency bridges from planks, and crawl
along these to escape from the danger zone.</p>

<p>Among the last memories, outside of fighting,
that the boys carried from Belgium, were of the
bedraggled men and women suffering through cold
and hunger.</p>

<p>The Germans had declared the territory west
of the railroad running from Brussels to Antwerp
an official war area, where nobody, including even
Germans, were allowed to travel without a special
military passport.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Jimmy, “we’re on the dead-line;
even if we could get into Antwerp, it’s ten to one
that we couldn’t get out, and so what’s the use
of getting in?”</p>

<p>“But I’d rather take the chances of getting out
of this wasp’s nest by water than by attempting<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
to break through any more wholesale killings on
the land.”</p>

<p>That was Billy’s view. He was war-worn.</p>

<p>“But we’re going back by water,” assured
Jimmy, “only it won’t have to be exactly from
Antwerp. I’ve voyaged several times to Flushing&mdash;that’s
in The Netherlands, you know&mdash;and once
among the Dutch, and in the Scheldt river. I know
a trick or two to get out on the North Sea.”</p>

<p>“You’re the captain on this trip,” conceded
Henri; “if we can’t sail from Antwerp, let’s push
along anywhere, so long as it’s up-coast, even to
The Hague. Once in neutral territory, some of
our troubles are over.”</p>

<p>“‘Some’ is the way to put it, Henri,” remarked
Billy, “for if you had said ‘all our troubles’ I’d
think you were figuring on our final rest at the
bottom of the sea.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s just this way,” continued Jimmy. “I
believe I know a route, rounding Antwerp on the
east, that will take us out of fighting ground, and
in the town of Santvlieto, on the Scheldt, I have
a friend who is mate on a trade vessel, regularly
running between Flushing and the channel. I feel
sure that he is home, for there are so many mines
planted in the North Sea now that it isn’t safe to
risk anything that isn’t insured to the limit.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t Santvlieto quite a way up the river<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
from Flushing?” asked Henri, who knew something
of the coast line near Antwerp.</p>

<p>“Easy distance in a boat,” advised Jimmy. “I’ve
been up and down several times with my friend.”</p>

<p>“Let’s take the matter up with the colonel,” suggested
Billy.</p>

<p>The boys all agreed to that, and the colonel
strongly advised them to get out of the war zone,
if they could do it in safety.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to part with you, though, my brave
boys, and,” particularly addressing Billy and Henri,
“I can never forget that it was you who gave my
dear dead son the best burial you could. I hope we
can go to that grave together some day. I will
never forget, either, that daring adventure of your
own when you saved our command from being annihilated.
Here, sergeant,” calling to that officer
who was drilling some raw recruits nearby, “come
and get your release as caretaker of these youngsters.”</p>

<p>Sergeant Scott stood as straight as a ramrod,
facing the colonel and his young friends.</p>

<p>When he heard what the boys proposed to do,
the sergeant bent his head for an instant, then
spoke gruffly, with a little husky note, too:</p>

<p>“Fall in, you lads; eyes right; salute!”</p>

<p>With all gravity salutes were exchanged.</p>

<p>“We can give them convoy, can’t we, colonel?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sergeant,” quickly replied the colonel,<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
“give them protection as far on the way as you
think best.”</p>

<p>With that the fine soldier and gentleman turned
to address some of the staff assembling for conference.</p>

<p>The protecting force of cavalry were with the
boys to a point within five miles of the frontier,
and all was clear.</p>

<p>The sergeant gave each of the boys an iron hand
grip, and, leading the horses the boys had ridden,
the troop wheeled and soon disappeared in a cloud
of dust.</p>

<p>Billy, Henri and the sergeant were to meet again,
but not in France or Belgium.</p>

<p>An hour later the boys were in neutral territory,
and it was the first breath they had drawn in
peace in many a day.</p>

<p>But of lasting peace, not yet.</p>

<p>Hans Troutman was at home, and sorry for it&mdash;not
because of the unexpected visit of his young
friend from Dover&mdash;he was delighted over that,&mdash;but
simply because Hans was a thrifty fellow who
did not like even to waste time, let alone money.</p>

<p>While the good mother in the little house on
the big river was setting the oilcloth table-cover,
with the kind of a meal that appeals to the robust
feeder, Henri was making a business proposition
to Hans.</p>

<p>Hans gloried in business propositions, and he<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
could understand them in three separate and distinct
languages.</p>

<p>Fifty gold franc pieces for his company and his
boat to Flushing.</p>

<p>Fifty more if he put the boys on a ship that was
bound for the English Channel.</p>

<p>“It’s just like finding it,” said Hans, lighting his
pipe.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXI" class="no-break">CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">LIKE A MIRACLE OF OLD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Three Dutch men-of-war, with steam up, lay
off Flushing, ready to defend the neutrality of
their waters.</p>

<p>All vessels were forbidden to clear from the
port and enter the North Sea after nightfall, and
on the sanded floor of the tap-room, in a sailors’
house of rest, our boys were impatiently scraping
their feet, awaiting sunrise. In their anxiety
to get away without submitting to intimate inspection,
they had no desire for napping.</p>

<p>With their belts, these boys represented a money
valuation of more than a million francs.</p>

<p>Since arrival in Flushing, the day before, Hans
had been an active mover at the mouth of the
Scheldt, and for shipping news an eager seeker.</p>

<p>At this particular date, the rumor among men<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
of the nautical trade was that, in the rough sea,
anchored mines were often going loose, and a bobbing
mine is not apt to have any discretion as to
the keel with which it collides.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard dozens of mines explode in a single
day,” said one captain to Hans. The latter had
heard a few himself.</p>

<p>In addition to mines, the sea was crowded with
torpedo boat destroyers, submarines of all sorts
and descriptions, and with cruisers the waters fairly
reeked. There, too, were the steam trawlers,
either engaged in laying or “sweeping” for mines.
These “sweepers” run in pairs. Between each pair
a steel net is suspended. The theory is that mines,
whether floating or anchored, will be caught by
that net. Then one of the destroyers, which are
constantly darting about, is signaled, and destroys
the mine by a single shot.</p>

<p>Overhead, Zeppelins and other aircraft continually
circled, dropping bombs where they would do
the most harm to those whom the airmen desired
to harm the most, and sometimes harm was done
without intent.</p>

<p>Once out of the Scheldt, and trouble was likely
to begin any minute, particularly for any craft
considered unfriendly by the British fleet.</p>

<p>A narrow lane had been slashed&mdash;as a woodsman
would say&mdash;through the sea. Outside of it
there was danger everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[148]</span></p>

<p>Such was the situation when Hans introduced
Captain Eberhardt to the restless four in the house
of rest.</p>

<p>The captain was a man of few words, and had
a firecracker way of delivering them.</p>

<p>He said he owned a “scow with a funnel in
it,” and he was one of the pilots who were trusted
to take boats through. The shoals in the shallow
and muddy water of the North Sea had been well
marked in times of peace, but now only here and
there to be seen by the men at the wheel, for guides,
were big red “war buoys.”</p>

<p>Henri had taken from the belts sufficient gold
for even extraordinary passage money for himself
and comrades, and jingled the coins on the deal
table at which the party were sitting.</p>

<p>“We want to get out of here at daybreak, if you
can swing it, captain,” he said.</p>

<p>The captain looked at the coins and then at his
watch, a massive silver timepiece, hitched to his
broad vest-front by twisted links of steel.</p>

<p>“Bring ’em down”&mdash;the captain addressing Hans
in Dutch.</p>

<p>Hans nodded assent, and kept the captain company
to the door, where they apparently completed
arrangements.</p>

<p>When the cuckoo in the clock, shelved above the
fancy tiled fireplace, warbled the hour of 4 a. m.,<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
Hans shook the sleepy attendant into a waking moment,
and hustled him after cakes and coffee.</p>

<p>At 5 o’clock Hans and the boys dropped again
into the boat in which they had floated down from
Santvlieto.</p>

<p>Captain Eberhardt’s vessel was in anchor in the
sloppy waters off Flushing, and the captain was
aboard when Hans and the boys climbed to the
deck.</p>

<p>The captain had also, just previously, been visited
by members of the coast guard service, but
as he was well known, and not a character under
suspicion, this visit was wholly informal.</p>

<p>At 7 o’clock the vessel weighed anchor, and
steamed out to sea.</p>

<p>With Flushing far behind them, the boys began
to notice an occasional appearance above the
waves of a slim gray periscope, a long tube fitted
with a series of prisms, which enable the men guiding
the submarines to obtain a view of the surrounding
water.</p>

<p>When several of these under water boats showed
at once, half submerged, and men could be seen
huddled together in the barrels of bridges, Jimmy’s
delight knew no bounds.</p>

<p>“What do you think of them, now, you flying
catapults?” he called to the boys.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t mind taking a ride in one, old top,”
was Billy’s genial observation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[150]</span></p>

<p>“You’d like it when you got used to it,” advised
Jimmy.</p>

<p>“What’s up now?”</p>

<p>Henri’s startled question referred to a dull
sound, that came from a point quartering to their
course, and a fountain of water spurting into the
air.</p>

<p>“A mine let go, I’ll bet,” surmised Henri.</p>

<p>“You’re right, and a corker, too,” admitted
Jimmy.</p>

<p>The captain had evidently sighted something else
from his position on the bridge, for his firecracker
voice shouted the order:</p>

<p>“Run up those flags!”</p>

<p>Three miles away a fleet of a half dozen destroyers
were tearing toward the little steamer, with
black bands of smoke striking down from each
raking funnel.</p>

<p>The captain on the bridge had seen an impatient
signal snapping from the flagship of the fleet.</p>

<p>The curiosity of the fleet was soon satisfied, but
the captain complained that they ought to have
known that he and his ship were no strangers in
these parts.</p>

<p>He little reckoned, then, that the good old hulk
was to get its wrecking blow that night from the
inside and not the outside.</p>

<p>The boys, when the bell strokes were counting
10 o’clock, were still in the vessel’s bow, where<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
they had been since the early evening, talking of
the many dangers that lurked in the misty nooks
of these turbulent waters.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll turn in,” yawned Billy. “This craft
is an awful drag; it’s been acting like a street car
on an avenue with two hundred crossings. Come
on, fellows.”</p>

<p>The words were hardly spoken, when the deck
beneath them gave a sickening heave, with a deafening
roar in its wake.</p>

<p>The time-worn boilers in the engine room had
rebelled at last, and, bursting, they split the seasoned
fabric that immediately confined them into
countless pieces.</p>

<p>By the upheaval the boys were violently thrown
over the deck railing and into the churning water
below.</p>

<p>Breathless and half-stunned, they instinctively
struck out in swimming stroke, and from them the
wreck drifted away into the darkness.</p>

<p>Weighted down by the heavy belts, in addition
to their clothing, the swimmers were soon exhausted.</p>

<p>The end was near!</p>

<p>They swam close together, anticipating it.</p>

<p>One more despairing reach for life&mdash;and life
was there!</p>

<p>The swimmers’ outstretched arms rested on the
bridge of a submarine!</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">LIKE A DREAM OF GOOD LUCK.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Through the conning tower hatch of the submarine
emerged a sailor, holding high a brilliant
flare that looked like a small searchlight.</p>

<p>“What’s your number, lads?” he hailed.</p>

<p>“Four of us, sir,” weakly responded Jimmy.</p>

<p>The sailor stepped out on the slippery deck of
the boat, that alternately rose and fell in the swell
of the sea.</p>

<p>“Whereaway?” questioned the sailor.</p>

<p>“To the bottom of the sea, if you don’t give
us a lift,” replied Jimmy.</p>

<p>The sailor turned to the hatch, sent a call below,
and two more jaunty tars sprang through the opening.</p>

<p>One of the last comers was just a youngster in
years, but evidently qualified for his dangerous
calling.</p>

<p>“By the ghost of Bloomsbury Park,” he exclaimed,
when extending a helping hand to Jimmy,
and when the latter’s face showed in the shine of
the flare, “if it isn’t Stetson!”</p>

<p>“I’ll be blowed if it isn’t Ned!” Jimmy had
joined familiar company, it seemed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[153]</span></p>

<p>“Seven hands ’round, Jimmy,” cried the young
sailor, “did you drop from the clouds?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Jimmy, wringing the water from his
cap, “I came by the boiler route to help celebrate
your birthday.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, Jimmy’s fellow swimmers had
been assisted to the deck, and were practicing again
the art of drawing a long breath.</p>

<p>All of the wet ones had begun to shiver, for
the wind had a sharp edge to it.</p>

<p>“Bring them below”&mdash;this command from the
conning tower, by a fourth sailor, who appeared
to speak with authority.</p>

<p>Glad of the chance to get under cover, the chilly
explosion survivors followed the officer below the
hatch, and immensely enjoyed the warmth of the
snug quarters.</p>

<p>“You’ll find this isn’t much of a passenger boat,
my lads; it fits too tight to suit most people.” This
remark from the officer showing the way.</p>

<p>“It felt mighty good to us when we couldn’t
find the bottom of the sea with our feet.”</p>

<p>Billy’s happy disposition was again working.</p>

<p>It was Jimmy’s hour, this business of being inside
of a submarine. Our Aviator Boys might be
princes of the air, but down here Jimmy Stetson
was the ace, and all the other cards. He could
not give Henri any points that would puzzle about
the gasoline engine that furnished the power when<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
the craft was running on the surface, and, perhaps,
not a great deal that was new about the electric
motor that propelled the boat when under the
water, but to all of the visiting boys, except Jimmy,
there was much of mystery about the way the vessel
was raised and lowered.</p>

<p>How, when the ballast tanks are full, they sink
the hull of the submarine until only the periscope
and top of the conning tower are visible, and, when
empty, the whole of the conning tower, superstructure,
and a portion of the hull ride above the
water.</p>

<p>How hydroplanes&mdash;short, broad fins&mdash;tilt the
nose of the vessel so that the propeller can drive
the craft down fifty or sixty feet.</p>

<p>Jimmy knew all about it, and the sailors let him
have all the pleasure of telling it to his wondering
companions.</p>

<p>The guarded screw propeller aft and outside, the
vertical steering rudders behind it, the air flasks
which supply the crew with air when the vessel
is submerged, the torpedo equipment&mdash;all the details
thereof were reeled off by the Dover boy
with great gusto.</p>

<p>Ned Belton, with whom Jimmy had trained for
submarine service in London, laughingly nominated
his friend, there and then, for head talker on a
sight-seeing ’bus.</p>

<p>With roving commission, the submarine was lazily<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
drifting, half submerged, within sight of the
lighthouse with the famous hexagonal tower, near
Nieuport-Bains, a little seaside resort in Belgium.</p>

<p>The boys had realized that it was considerable
of a cramp for the submarine to carry passengers
in the limited space allotted to the crew, and barring
this extreme emergency, it would not have
done at all for this fighting machine to serve any
other than the purpose intended.</p>

<p>It was agreed that the submarine would go as
far as Dunkirk, in the hope that opportunity would
there present itself for the passengers to pursue
the returning course in some other vessel.</p>

<p>A surprise beyond any dream of great fortune
awaited them at Dunkirk.</p>

<p>This port just then was a working out point
for aircraft for scout duty on the North Sea.</p>

<p>From the conning tower of the submarine Henri
and Billy were watching with keen interest the
aërial maneuvers then in progress. Suddenly the
lighter machines were overshadowed by a flying
shape that darted like an eagle among sparrows.</p>

<p>The long, tapering hull, and the float attachments,
the trim, wicked gun in the bow, proclaimed
this giant patrol of the air a fighting sea-plane.</p>

<p>With engines quiet, down dived the great steel-breasted
bird; then a swift upturning and she shot
level upon the water and rode the waves like a
swan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[156]</span></p>

<p>A stone could easily have been tossed from the
bridge of the submarine upon the upper plane of
the aircraft, so near together were they.</p>

<p>The pilot of the sea-plane turned to view the
rival factor in modern warfare, half rising as he
did so.</p>

<p>Mutual recognition flashed across the few separating
yards of distance.</p>

<p>“Hello, captain!” shouted Billy.</p>

<p>“Hello yourself, Billy Barry!” came the answering
shout.</p>

<p>“Whoopee!” This was Josh Freeman’s joyful
contribution, as he poked a grimy face from the
tiny engine room of the big flyer.</p>

<p>“Sling us a line,” called the captain.</p>

<p>Ned made the cast with a stout bit of hemp, and
the aircraft was drawn alongside of the submarine.</p>

<p>“Put ’er there, boys,” commanded Captain
Johnson, reaching for Billy’s outstretched hand;
“and there’s Henri, bless you, my lad; give me the
grip; sure this is good for sore eyes.”</p>

<p>Josh did not stop at handshaking, he encircled
both boys in his brawny arms and set their ribs to
cracking.</p>

<p>“Well, for all that’s out,” exclaimed the captain,
spying Jimmy, who was just appearing above
the hatch, “here’s a whole garden of daisies! Tip
us your fin, Jimmy, and let me tell you that your
mother is looking for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[157]</span></p>

<p>“Why, I thought you had gone for a soldier, you
Dover dandy,” put in Josh, as he playfully saluted
Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Here’s another of the flock,” said Billy, pushing
Reddy forward for inspection.</p>

<p>“When I get all of you aboard,” commented
the captain, “it will look like I was trying to outdo
Noah. But come a runnin’ and I’ll pack you all in
somewhere, being as there are two lightweights
among the four,” referring to Jimmy and Reddy,
“and none of you much heavier than a pound of
butter.”</p>

<p>The crew of the submarine came in for some
heartfelt expressions of gratitude on the part of
the boys, whose lives they had saved, and Ned was
privately made banker for some tobacco money
for the men.</p>

<p>“This is like old times,” contentedly remarked
Billy, as he heard again the drone of the sea-plane
motors.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIII" class="no-break">CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE SEALED PACKET.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“We’re not in the soldier business,” explained
Captain Johnson to the boys; “it’s just a ‘trying
out’ on contract on which we are now engaged.
The old machine is somewhere in Ostend, and I<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
guess it’s going to be a dead loss to us. You ask
how we broke out of Ypres. Well, we convinced
a good sport in authority that it was just the wind
that blew us into the German lines, and we would
favor any gale that would blow us out again.</p>

<p>“He had seen us as aërial performers once upon
a time at Ostend, and being an infantryman of
the old school, he privately regarded the whole flying
fraternity in the light of circus stars. He did,
however, concede that if anything counted for
much above ground, it was the invention of his
friend, Count Zeppelin.</p>

<p>“As matters warmed up around Ypres, we were
hustled back to Ostend, and hung around there for
some time, on parole, they called it, until one day
we were permitted to board a hospital ship bound
for Calais.</p>

<p>“We can’t show any scars, nor bullet holes in
our clothes&mdash;not a thing to add to our glorious
achievement of turning you boys loose in the war
zone.”</p>

<p>The captain by this time had heard all about the
adventures of his young friends.</p>

<p>“In this fuel test,” he continued, “we can give
you a lift that may pretty near, if not quite, land
you where you want to go. I wouldn’t mind sailing
into Paris myself, but there are no free agents
at the working end of a contract. I don’t know
yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[159]</span></p>

<p>“Wake me and shake me at the mouth of the
Thames,” exulted Jimmy, “show me the docks at
Tilbury, see that there is a light in the window
for me at Dover, and then won’t I be the horse for
the Paris wagon!”</p>

<p>“Bully boy!” applauded Josh.</p>

<p>“Now get snug, you youngsters,” said the captain&mdash;“two
in the bow and two aft with Josh.”</p>

<p>“Give her power, Freeman.”</p>

<p>The planes were set for the upward flight, and
the course for the Straits of Dover.</p>

<p>Reddy was the only “cat in a strange garret”
when the sea-plane cut through the air. The little
Frenchman had never had a like sensation, and
he soon began to revel in it, even though he could
look sheer down through 3,000 feet of space and
see the heaving sea.</p>

<p>The captain lowered the flight along the French
coast, for the soldiers all down the line had been
warned not to fire on the sea-plane, it having been
generally announced in wireless orders that it was
an English airship out on a trial run. The schedule
included Boulogne, and the boys had the opportunity
of looking down upon the city where
Napoleon had once encamped his troops.</p>

<p>Swinging ’round and circling backward, the sea-plane
hovered over Calais. Somebody had evidently
forgotten orders, for when the big machine
was directly above the military governor’s headquarters<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
a half dozen or more soldiers seized their
rifles and commenced firing at the aviators. Out
rushed an officer, crying:</p>

<p>“C’est un Anglais! C’est un Anglais! Ne tirez
plus!” (It is an Englishman! It is an Englishman!
Stop firing!)</p>

<p>The sea-plane dropped into the harbor off Calais,
and all except Josh, remaining as faithful
guardian of his precious motors, went ashore.</p>

<p>The captain there hoped to solve the problem
of getting his young friends safely to Paris, and
the boys certainly wished him the best kind of
luck in the effort. Both French approval and English
backing would help some in the way of hastening
unmolested progress.</p>

<p>On Rue de Moscow the boys discovered that
these were days when there was something doing
every minute in Calais. Clouds of smoke rose
from sputtering motors, whizzing to and fro, some
loaded with soldiers, some with food, while others
were hastening for the field of battle.</p>

<p>Refugees from almost everywhere in the war
zone filled the town to the point of overflow&mdash;and
such a medley of French and Flemish! Men wearing
blood-stained bandages, old women, babies in
arms, worn out and half starved.</p>

<p>The great warehouses, the Hotel de Ville, the
railway station, lace factories, private residences,<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
and even ships in the harbor, were used as sleeping
quarters.</p>

<p>“We can’t get away from it,” sighed Henri, as
the party noted a limping procession of Belgian
soldiers caked with mud, worn faces covered with
three or four weeks’ growth of beard, and who
looked like they had exhausted the last drop of
energy and patience they had.</p>

<p>“And they are coming in by the thousands,”
volunteered a bystander.</p>

<p>The boys waited near the Maritime station while
the captain made his visit of state to one in authority,
with whom he was well acquainted.</p>

<p>Presently the captain hove in sight, accompanied
by a Belgian gendarme, one of the force then engaged
in patrolling the city. This was evidently
a guard of honor, for the captain had no appearance
of being disturbed by arrest.</p>

<p>“Now, youngsters,” he briskly announced, “there
is a bit of a conference arranged for you, so put
on your best front. It won’t be like a visit to a
dentist, I assure you.”</p>

<p>In a street not far removed from the Victoria
hotel, the captain ushered his young charges into
the vestibule of a pretentious looking residence,
and guided by a smiling secretary the visitors were
soon in the presence of a man of most distinguished
bearing and cordial manner, who instantly rose
from his chair behind a desk littered with papers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[162]</span></p>

<p>“I have the pleasure, I believe,” he said in English,
with only a trace of the softer accent, “of
making the acquaintance of young men who fly
like birds, and, also, who have seen much in the
battlefields.”</p>

<p>The boys bent their heads in acknowledgment of
his kindly accusation.</p>

<p>“The captain here tells me that you have an important
mission in Paris, of a strictly personal
nature,” continued the genial host, when all were
seated.</p>

<p>“We have, sir,” responded Henri.</p>

<p>“You are a Trouville, I understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Henri.</p>

<p>“I know that family well,” observed the questioner.
“Some of my people and yours, history
tells, had mutual interests in the long ago.”</p>

<p>“I am very proud of that, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why, you are quite a young diplomat,” laughed
the gentleman behind the desk.</p>

<p>“But,” he continued, “it is at the present we are
looking.”</p>

<p>“My dear Anglin,” turning to his ever smiling
secretary, “hand me that portfolio.”</p>

<p>From the portfolio case the speaker took a sealed
packet, closed by red wax, and tape-wound.</p>

<p>“In Paris, my dear boy,” addressing Henri, “you
will deliver this to the address written thereon,
and,” in impressive tone, “I should regret exceedingly<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
if it should fall into any other hands than
those authorized to receive it.</p>

<p>“Remember that!</p>

<p>“The captain will give you all other necessary
instructions.</p>

<p>“My young friends, permit me to say bon soir.”
(Good evening.)</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">AT THE FRONT DOOR OF PARIS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“You made quite a hit with his nobs,” remarked
Billy to Henri when the party reached the street,
and started for the Maritime station.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t he fine, though!” exclaimed Henri.</p>

<p>“You’ll find that he has the say when it comes
to moving about in France these times,” asserted
the captain. “You’re a lucky lot, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“I think we owe you something for all this, captain,”
suggested Billy.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” replied the captain, “that’s all in
the family, anyhow. There’s a certain old gentleman
over in the States who never went back on me&mdash;and
you are a down-to-date picture of him,
Billy.”</p>

<p>Josh had given the engine end of the sea-plane<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
a thorough overhauling, refilled the tanks, and was
ready, he claimed, to sail to the moon.</p>

<p>“Never saw such a hungry place as Calais is
now,” he grumbled. “The old lady running the
nearest bakery told me a little while ago that she
never sold so much bread before in all her life,
and the ovens couldn’t half keep up with the demand.
I don’t believe, either, that there is a cupful
of milk in the town.”</p>

<p>“You seem to have fallen down as a grub hunter,
old man,” jested the captain. “But there is no
use growling,” he added, “the machine lockers are
pretty full yet.”</p>

<p>Indeed, there was no immediate danger of the
airmen starving.</p>

<p>Henri was chiefly occupied, during the exchange
between the captain and Josh, in thinking of the
new care put upon him in the matter of the sealed
packet, and if it was once, it was twenty times in
the hour, that he clutched at his breast, where
the parcel reposed. The carrying of jewels and
gold around his waist he passed as an old experience.
It was merely a habit, now.</p>

<p>But the mystery about the packet appealed to
the boy, and imagination magnified the trust until
it weighed about a ton on his mind.</p>

<p>The captain had not yet revealed his program
of action, and it was with great difficulty that<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
Henri restrained his growing impatience at the
delay.</p>

<p>After a hearty attack on the food supply of the
sea-plane, the captain, behind a pipeful of the stoutest
tobacco to be found on the continent, announced
that there would be no flying that night. The skipper
of a fishing smack had just brought in the
rumor from Dover that several bombs had been
dropped from hostile aëroplanes upon that famous
fortified naval harbor. The skipper had also heard
that the damage inflicted by the bombs was light.
The captain, under the circumstances, could not
well afford to take chances with a costly machine
that did not belong to him, by night flight. With
such rumors on the wireless flashing down the
coast, there was no telling what might happen to
an aviator who could not show his colors.</p>

<p>From this it may be surmised that the captain
had no instructions to put the boys on the night
express from Calais to Paris.</p>

<p>“Say, captain, how long do we have to stay
here?”</p>

<p>Henri had set to angling for information.</p>

<p>“Overnight, anyhow,” briefly replied the captain.
The truth of the matter is, he was secretly enjoying
this bit of teasing, and, further, he was himself
in doubt until a certain messenger should arrive
with a wired for permit to use the sea-plane out
of designated area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[166]</span></p>

<p>Here the magic in the name of the authority to
whom the captain had appealed that day in Calais
was first in evidence. Though all people in the
town were forbidden to ride on bicycles after 9
p. m., this rigid rule then prevailing was apparently
not enforced against a wheelman who arrived at
the Maritime station at 10 o’clock, with a yellow
envelope addressed to Captain Johnson.</p>

<p>The captain read the message, pocketed it,
knocked the ashes out of his pipe, told Josh to set
the lights in the floating sea-plane and to take the
first watch, promising relief at 1 o’clock. The
friendly skipper invited them all to spread their
blankets on the deck of the smack.</p>

<p>At dawn the sea-plane splashed a start and took
to the air.</p>

<p>“We’re off for Havre!”</p>

<p>This from the man at the wheel.</p>

<p>Havre, at the mouth of the Seine, and the sea-port
for Paris, next to Marseilles the most important
in France.</p>

<p>Henri now had a fair idea of the route they
were to follow.</p>

<p>“It’s simply great of you, captain,” acclaimed
Henri.</p>

<p>“I said ‘near, if not quite,’ you remember,”
trumpeted the captain, for the noise of the flying
machine would have drowned any softer sound.</p>

<p>“Oh, you Havre!” cried Jimmy, when shipmasts<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
loomed like a forest of bare poles far below.</p>

<p>With marked precision and care, the captain
swung into the port, which thousands of water-craft
entered every year.</p>

<p>The coming of the sea-plane had evidently been
heralded by a swifter agent of the air, the wonderful
wireless, for no sooner had the flying machine
found clear space in the basin, than it was rapidly
approached by a small motor-boat, in which were
seated three men, the one looking out from the
elevated bow exhibiting an empty coat sleeve and
the glitter of an honor decoration upon his breast.</p>

<p>“Is it Rue Castiglione?” he hailed.</p>

<p>“No; it is Rue de Rivoli,” called the captain.</p>

<p>Only names of noted boulevards in Paris&mdash;and
evidently used in agreement to insure recognition.</p>

<p>With the uttering of the passwords, there was
no further attempt to speak in riddles.</p>

<p>“Which of the boys?”</p>

<p>He of the one arm was closely inspecting the
sea-plane company.</p>

<p>The captain nodded toward Henri.</p>

<p>“Your hand, young sir,” said he with only one
to offer. “I knew your father before you, and
of that I am proud.”</p>

<p>Henri was beginning to believe that a Trouville
could not be lost in France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[168]</span></p>

<p>“Come into the boat,” urged this new found
friend.</p>

<p>“But there are three more to go,” stated Henri.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see, you have attendants?”</p>

<p>“Not that, my dear sir; we are all of one rank,
and we move on the same spring.”</p>

<p>“What you wish is a command,” politely conceded
the man in the boat; “will the four come
aboard?”</p>

<p>“It’s all in the deal,” said the captain, in a low
tone to Henri. “I’ll have to quit here, and you
boys are to go on. But it’s good luck and not good-by
that I’m saying now. It’s not far to Dover,
you know.”</p>

<p>When the motor chugged away, the four boys
were in it.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXV" class="no-break">CHAPTER XXXV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE FLIGHT UP THE SEINE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The motor-boat swiftly threaded its way into
the Seine, guided with the greatest skill, for it was
a crowded waterway, and landing was made at
the base of a stone staircase leading to extensive
grounds, surrounding one of those old time mansions
still holding its dignity against the modern
building advances and commercial activity now
prevailing in what was once Havre de Grace,<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
named from a chapel of Notre Dame de Grace,
founded in 1509.</p>

<p>From a large bay window of an upper room
of the mansion, to which the boys were taken by
order of the man with the empty sleeve, they could
see great ship building yards and the tall chimneys
of sugar refineries.</p>

<p>Looking at the tapestry-hung walls, Billy remarked:
“This reminds me of Arras.”</p>

<p>“Sure, it does,” agreed Henri. “But,” he added,
“without the noise of the big guns.”</p>

<p>“Wonder if it isn’t train time?”</p>

<p>Jimmy evidently did not approve of all this ceremony
over the short journey still before them.</p>

<p>“You’d think it was an affair of state,” he concluded.</p>

<p>“But you must remember, Jimmy,” advised
Henri, “that Paris is something of a closed town,
these days. They are not advertising for visitors
up there, unless they come in uniform, and of the
right color. I, for one, don’t want to be searched,”
feeling for the packet inside his shirt-front, and
giving also a tug to the treasure belt.</p>

<p>“Right you are,” approved Billy, “and when
you figure that we haven’t a passport among us.
Mine was soaked to a pulp when that old scow
blew up and strewed the sea with us. I couldn’t
this minute prove that I was from Bangor.”</p>

<p>“We’re all members of the Don’t Worry club,<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
and we have always alighted on our feet,” was
Henri’s cheerful view. “Besides, we’re traveling
under sealed orders, so to speak, and it’s up to the
fellow who is personally conducting this excursion.”</p>

<p>The last mentioned personage just then put in
appearance, smiling and making apology for being
so long away from his guests.</p>

<p>“I have some rare good news for you,” he impressively
announced&mdash;“and a plan that will be
much to your liking, I think”&mdash;looking at Henri,
and with a side glance at Billy.</p>

<p>“The letter from my friend, whose name I shall
not mention, and which monsieur the captain handed
to me, I had not read until I left you, and I
knew not until the reading that of the air two
of you are masters. It is splendid, and it so beautifully
fits. Pardon the enthusiasm of a Frenchman,
but so superb is the idea, I must speak this
way. You shall go to Paris, not among the locked
in of the railway carriages, not in the cabin of
some little steamer&mdash;like a bird you shall go. Is
it not grand?”</p>

<p>Billy had begun to believe that the speaker had
stopped too often in the cafés during the visit
downtown, but so convincing was the statement
which followed that he felt sorry for holding such
a belief:</p>

<p>“In this port there have just arrived three of<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
the new military aëroplanes, so much larger than
the little ones that have been sent out from the
forts in Paris for scouting&mdash;these bigger ones give
room for an observer to move and signal, and
the pilot may attend alone to his duty of managing
the machine.</p>

<p>“You understand the foreign make?”</p>

<p>It would evidently have been a sore disappointment
to the eager proposer if the answer were contrary
to his hope.</p>

<p>“They all look alike to us,” assured Henri.</p>

<p>“Glorious! It is but the one thing, to put together
these fine birds, to fly them to Paris, and
when they are there, so you are there. What benefit
for all. Gilbert! Gilbert!”</p>

<p>Responding to the call of the excitable host, a
stocky built youth with a shock of coal-black hair
of such length that it mixed with his eyebrows,
and who had evidently been awaiting the result
of the conference upstairs, sauntered through the
doorway.</p>

<p>“For what would you take him?”</p>

<p>Billy thought that he would not “take him” at
any price for beauty, but he politely guessed:</p>

<p>“Artist?”</p>

<p>“Ah! That is it&mdash;he is one artist like yourselves&mdash;he
is the great scout of the air. Gilbert LeFane
of Rouen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[172]</span></p>

<p>“I fear it is too much honor, monsieur, that
you have bestowed upon me. I but serve.”</p>

<p>“But what gallant service it is. Permit me now,
my dear Gilbert, to present the youths who also
fly with the best, Monsieur Trouville and Baree,
also the young men who travel with them.”</p>

<p>Jimmy and Reddy felt a couple of inches growth
through the tops of their heads. Billy was thinking
how “Baree” would sound in Bangor.</p>

<p>Gilbert spoke rapidly and to the point. He was
here to receive the aëroplanes which had been
specially built for his government. An expert assistant
in assembling these machines was overdue,
and it was a matter of emergency&mdash;of great emergency,
he emphasized.</p>

<p>To his patriotic friend, who had so generously
praised him a few minutes before, he had confided
his troubles, and this meeting was arranged.
Would the young gentlemen volunteer for this
relief service?</p>

<p>The young gentlemen would&mdash;and did, and in
less than a day, the new machines were set to the
tune of flight.</p>

<p>The master of the mansion was a picture of delight
over the success of that which he had brought
about, and even cherished a fond hope that he had
permanently added to the flying corps of his beloved
France.</p>

<p>He assured the boys that when they followed<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
Gilbert in the air trip up the Seine to the capital,
it was insuring them a welcome beyond anything
they could have expected&mdash;doubly welcome, indeed,
with this and with the endorsement of the power
at Calais.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew how far his knowledge goes
regarding the sealed packet that I am carrying,”
thought Henri.</p>

<p>But about this, Henri discreetly resolved not to
ask any questions.</p>

<p>As to the manner of proceeding on their aërial
journey, it was decided, of course, that Gilbert
should lead in one machine, Henri and Reddy in
the second, and Billy and Jimmy in the third.</p>

<p>They followed the course of the river, as the
crow flies, land crossing and cutting out the big
bends, and with never a mishap, so perfectly were
the machines adjusted and so expertly managed&mdash;a
master hand at every wheel.</p>

<p>Billy said to Jimmy that surely Joseph’s coat
never had as many buttons on it as there were
towns, little and big, along this line of travel.</p>

<p>But when he looked down on Paris, on its quays
and embankments, on its magnificent public squares,
on its beautiful gardens, on its lofty towers, all
surrounded by twenty-two miles of fortifications,
Billy rested on the guiding wheel in silent admiration.</p>

<p>The grim visage of war was pale in the distance.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXVI" class="no-break">CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE WAY THAT WENT WRONG.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Along the outworks of Paris our Aviator Boys
had the delight of hearing of the war exploits
of some of the greatest airmen of their time, Paulhan,
the hero of the English tour from London
to Manchester; Brindejonc des Moulinais, Garros,
Vedrines, and last, but not least, the very Gilbert
LeFane, whom they had followed through the air
from Havre to the capital.</p>

<p>While it had been said that French aëroplanes
had never been seen above the French lines, though
many machines of the opposing power were constantly
reconnoitering over the heads of the French
soldiers, it was well known within the circle that
this aviation corps had been operating not only
on the German lines, but considerably to the rear
of them, and many and brilliant were the achievements
of intimate record.</p>

<p>Within the first few hours after their arrival
in Paris&mdash;not the laughter-loving city of yesterday,
but the militant Paris of to-day&mdash;the boys
had a glimpse of the military dictator, the commanding
figure of the hour, General Joffre, on
whom all France relies&mdash;a man of medium height,
stout, with a massive head, thick drooping mustache,<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
and heavy eyebrows nearly concealing his
eyes.</p>

<p>As Gilbert remarked, “he had an easy-going
manner until he sets his jaws. By the way,” he
added, “how would you like to show him what the
new machines can do?”</p>

<p>To perform before General Joffre! Our Aviator
Boys fairly gasped at the idea. So closely
had they been allied with military doings, and so
easily does the war spirit expand by such association,
that a great field commander was just
about the very top of the list with them. Legions
gave devotion to General Joffre and General Sir
John French.</p>

<p>From the first line of fortifications, over the
enceinte (works forming the main inclosure), to
the detached forts still beyond, there was a splendid
natural theater for the aërial exhibit, 430 square
miles thus enclosed, with an encircling line of 77
miles.</p>

<p>“These machines are certainly the very ‘last
word’ in aëroplane construction,” observed Henri,
when Gilbert, Billy and himself moved about the
hangars engaged in the “tuning up” process.</p>

<p>“Something like the machine in which young
Bainbridge took his last ride,” recalled Billy.</p>

<p>In all their lives the boys could never forget
that sad incident.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the passenger-carrying capacity<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
of the new aircraft, Gilbert was accompanied in
the leading flight by a comrade airman, while Henri
took Reddy, and Billy chummed with Jimmy.</p>

<p>The graceful evolutions, and, particularly, the
lightning speed shown by the up-to-date machines,
excited admiration and wonder. Practically the
entire length of the encircling line was traversed
in an hour&mdash;that is, 77 miles an hour!</p>

<p>Jimmy and Reddy had never before traveled like
a ball from a cannon, and even for the practiced
aviators it was a little more than their limit.</p>

<p>“The general can’t say that there was anything
slow about this,” asserted Billy, when he climbed
down from the wheel-seat at the close of the thrilling
performance.</p>

<p>“It was good work.”</p>

<p>Gilbert was a man of few words, and he always
meant what he said.</p>

<p>He showed that when he said to Henri and Billy,
in his earnest way:</p>

<p>“The flying corps would count it a big day if
your services could be secured for regular duty.”</p>

<p>“But we are not ready to settle down yet,” was
Billy’s plea. He did not want to tie himself to
any foreign job.</p>

<p>“It is a temptation,” admitted Henri, “yet I must
decide with Billy. It’s a partnership that won’t
break.”</p>

<p>“And which reminds me,” he went on, “that we<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
have a pressing duty elsewhere, and now that we
have given this day to show our gratitude to the
kind Gilbert, it is very necessary that we hurry on.”</p>

<p>“All the obligation owing is mine,” stoutly maintained
Gilbert; “you have a thousand times paid
for your ride to Paris. Can I do any more now
to get a nearer balance?”</p>

<p>“Only give us some directions that we want, and
for possible need, something in writing, to ward off
suspicious soldiers or gendarmes.”</p>

<p>Gilbert provided both, and would also have sent
a trooper or two with them had not Henri protested
against it.</p>

<p>He felt that having set out on a secret mission,
he was going to play the game that way.</p>

<p>It chanced that they must pass through one of
the older parts of the city to reach the destination
fixed by the address on the packet. It also happened,
in this time of war, that of vehicles for
hire there were very few running in the central
part of the city&mdash;and there were none at all to be
seen in these outskirts and wilderness of narrow,
irregular streets.</p>

<p>Henri had not figured on such a condition as
no means of public conveyance, for it had not yet
been fully impressed upon him that this was not
the same Paris he had known in the past. It was
now a city fearful; not a city wonderful.</p>

<p>Getting lost in this part of Paris, and when<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
the Apache bandits and ghouls of the night found
less restraint and greater need, was no merry jest.
Henri began to vainly wish that he had accepted
Gilbert’s offer of an escort. Billy and himself had
encountered so many big things in the way of danger
and peril in the last few months, so many close
calls on land and sea, above and below, that this
adventure at first seemed of little moment.</p>

<p>Yet the sinister, lurking menace of these silent,
shadowy highways and byways in this beleaguered
city was heightened by its very contrast with the
scenes of turmoil in which the boys had participated,
and where death stalked them with open
hand.</p>

<p>“I’m stumped if I know just where Gilbert told
me to make the turn that would set us straight for
the Rue de Rivoli. Here’s night come upon us,
and the high lights all out for fear of the Zeppelins,
so you really can’t tell whether you are going
or coming. Never thought for a moment but what
we could hail a cab before this.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, then, with turning back,
Henri?” questioned Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Nothing the matter with ‘turning,’” replied
Henri, “but where is ‘back’?”</p>

<p>Jimmy did not know, so he had nothing more
to say on the subject.</p>

<p>The four at the moment were passing a seemingly
endless row of tumble-down tenements. The<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
street was cobbled, or had been many years ago,
and of sidewalks there was hardly a trace. At
a far-away crossing ahead, an imitation of a lamp-post
held up the kind of light one might expect
from the fag-end of a candle. Behind, the darkness
hung like a curtain.</p>

<p>“What a hold-up we would make,” muttered
Billy, as he tightened a belt worth something like
a quarter of a million francs.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXVII" class="no-break">CHAPTER XXXVII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">OUT OF A SPIDER’S WEB.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>A bundle of rags huddled in the doorway of
one of the shaky old houses took unto itself life
and height. In a gargoyle face snaky eyes balefully
glistened at the sight of prey. The boys,
who in a moment of indecision had stopped within
earshot of this hideous, hidden thing, were about
to resume their way through this wretched street,
in the scant hope of finding some clew to their
whereabouts under the feeble glow from the dimly
distant lamp-post.</p>

<p>If there had ever been any gendarmes bold
enough to regularly patrol this gruesome thoroughfare,
these heroes were certainly not in evidence
now. They must either have gone directly to war<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
or were on guard in some more prosperous locality.</p>

<p>In fact, this dilapidated neighborhood appeared
to be generally deserted, for even of prowlers not
a one up to the minute had given a sign of open
movement in the long square.</p>

<p>There had been a lamplighter at the crossing,
however, and that was something on which to hang
a belief that there might be more of his kind further
on.</p>

<p>“Say, Henri, I don’t believe graveyards were
mentioned in the directions Gilbert gave you.”</p>

<p>“This is no joke, Jimmy, and you would never
have seen the like in Paris if it wasn’t for the
war. To save my life, though, I can’t imagine
where all the people that belong here could have
gone.”</p>

<p>“There are some that we might not care to meet
after dark,” suggested Billy.</p>

<p>As they talked the boys were groping their way
over the rough cobbles toward the one promise&mdash;meaning
the lamp-post.</p>

<p>As they passed, single file, the blank front of
a tenement where the crooked street curved inward,
a crouching, cat-like something leaped from
the rear upon Henri’s shoulders, and clawing fingers
sought his throat.</p>

<p>Henri wildly struggling to break the strangle
hold of the wiry arms, and bewildered by the shock<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
of sudden assault, made no outcry, and Billy, next
in line, did not realize for an instant or two what
had happened to his comrade.</p>

<p>He felt a loose stone under his foot in the worn
and broken pavement, in a second made a weapon
of it, and poised alert to strike at the assailant of
his chum. The streak of lamplight was so flickering
and uncertain, and Henri being dragged further
and further into the deepest shadow of the
overhanging doorway&mdash;the web of the human spider&mdash;that
Billy feared to risk a chance blow.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Jimmy and Reddy, warned
by quick ears, had turned to face the shuffling
charge of another creature of the night. There
were more of the spiders, it seemed.</p>

<p>Billy found an opening to lay a sounding whack
with the flat stone on the back of the writhing
thing that hung upon the shoulders of his friend,
and such was the force of the blow that Henri was
freed for a moment from the horrid embrace.</p>

<p>He struck out blindly for himself and knocked
the bundle of rags into a shrunken heap upon the
pavement. The fallen creature uttered an acute,
piercing sound, and slinking shapes responded,
front and rear.</p>

<p>Reddy had used a French close-fighting trick,
and planted a kick under the chin of the assailant
with whom Jimmy and himself were contending,
and the English boy made his count with a straight-from-the-shoulder<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
right blow right on the beak
of another onrushing shape.</p>

<p>“Together, boys! Together!”</p>

<p>Billy’s fighting blood was up.</p>

<p>The four closed in, dashed forward several
yards and backed against the door of the tenement
just around the curve and where the street ran
straight. This gave them the advantage of all
the light the crossing lamp-post afforded. It was
not much, but as Jimmy panted, it “helped some.”</p>

<p>The house where the boys presented determined
front to the now swarming human spiders was
apparently of a far better class than the tumble-down
hovels in the row around the curve&mdash;a contrast
so often presented in the big cities. It rose
to a height of four stories, of brick with stone
trimmings. But every shutter in the front was
tightly closed, and if occupied there was no light
nor sound to indicate the fact.</p>

<p>Hemmed in by the menacing circle, the boys
mounted heel by heel, never turning their heads,
the stone steps of the house, rising to the wide and
solid oak door with a brass knocker projecting from
its panels.</p>

<p>Here was the last stand against the spider crew&mdash;no
way of retreat.</p>

<p>The ragged gang were muttering ugly threats in
the mixed language of the slums, and knives were<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
gripped in every hand. They were preparing for
an overpowering rush upon their prey.</p>

<p>The boys knew that without other defense than
their fists and their feet they had no show at all
to stop an attack in force.</p>

<p>“Give the high note for help, Reddy.”</p>

<p>Henri had heard the little Frenchman’s “high
note” in the hills of the Meuse, and it was a ringer.</p>

<p>Reddy set up a shriek in the still watches of
the night that would have shamed a steam whistle.</p>

<p>“Secours! Secours!” (Help! Help!)</p>

<p>The immediate response was the cast of a knife,
which whizzed close to the head of the shrieker
and struck, shivering, in a door panel.</p>

<p>“I’d give something big for a gun,” offered
Billy when repeated yells for help in chorus had
counted for nothing.</p>

<p>“Here they come!” shouted Henri.</p>

<p>“Let ’em think we’re still in the ring.”</p>

<p>Billy followed the words by heaving the paving
stone, which he had retained for the finish, into
the thick of the leaping spiders.</p>

<p>Pressed against the door, the boys gave up all
hope of escaping the knives of their assailants.</p>

<p>Jimmy as a last duty kept the brass knocker
thumping like a bass-drum.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door swung back, the boys fell
into the opening like a cluster of ninepins scattered
by a bowling ball, and as quickly the door slammed<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
shut in the faces of the baffled spiders. The boys
heard the settling sound of heavy bolts in their
sockets.</p>

<p>The hall into which the four had tumbled with
so little ceremony was sable black to the sight,
and with the settling of the bolts as silent as the
grave.</p>

<p>“If this isn’t about the rummest go yet, I don’t
know what,” was Billy’s stage whisper, as he
rubbed a bruised elbow.</p>

<p>“If there’s any next to this, lead me to it quick.”</p>

<p>Jimmy was finding a deal of swift action since
he joined issue with our Aviator Boys.</p>

<p>“You have cause to be on your knees to the
Power above that you were delivered from that
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canaille</i> (mob) outside. They would have left
only your bones for the rats to knaw.”</p>

<p>Thus were the boys solemnly addressed, in deep
voice, by some person unseen, but near them, in
the dark recesses of the hall.</p>

<p>The speaker was then revealed as he opened
a door of a lighted room.</p>

<p>A man of almost imperial bearing, but white-haired
and slightly bent with age, wearing a skull
cap of velvet and a long study gown of the same
material.</p>

<p>The room into which the boys were invited was
typical of the scholar, the open books on the table,<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
under the shaded lamp, and the hundreds of volumes
displayed in wall-cases.</p>

<p>Unknown to them, the boys stood in the presence
of one of the most eminent philosophers of
the age.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE FORTUNE DELIVERED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“To one of those dictates of the mind for which
there is sometimes no accounting,” gravely stated
the scholar, “you owe your lives, my young friends.
Within these walls,” indicating the room by a
sweep of the hand, “I hear no sound. But I was
moved to open yonder door, and the drumming
of the knocker drew me to the front entrance.
By the cries for help I knew someone was in distress.
At all times the side streets about here
are dangerous for night travel, and in these times
there is no protection at all. You came a strange
way, my boys.”</p>

<p>“I had forgotten that it was not like it used to
be,” explained Henri, “and, too, I made a wrong
turn, owing to the fact that the tower lights no
longer serve to guide.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued the scholar, “the new element
of warfare, the death-dealing airships, are responsible
for that precaution. But in the morning my<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
man, Armand, will set you right. He has gone
up into the city for food supplies, and will not
return to-night. Rest with me until then.”</p>

<p>With the light of day, and it was a glorious sunlit
day, the terrors of the past night folded their
wings and disappeared.</p>

<p>Armand well fitted into such a day; he was a
jolly fellow, all smiles and a waistband that extended
a long way ’round. He could not for the
life of him see, he declared, how the boys ever
got into queer street, when the way (to him) was
so straight to the big boulevards. He was full of
a story how he had seen some great flying by noted
aviators only the day before.</p>

<p>“It is wonderful, this flying, is it not?”</p>

<p>This question as much to promote his enthusiasm
as anything else.</p>

<p>“How fine is that Gilbert,” he rambled on, “and,
to think, two young boys who also traveled the air
just like the master.”</p>

<p>“It just happens, my friend,” said Henri, “that
those two boys are standing close to you this blessed
minute.”</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu!” (Goodness me!)</p>

<p>Armand was a slave from that minute.</p>

<p>He must tell the great doctor in the library all
about it. And the great doctor himself also had
a second look at his young guests.</p>

<p>His was a kindly farewell, but he lifted a hand<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
when the boys tried to thank him for the boon
of life he had conferred by his action of the night.</p>

<p>“In your prayers, my boys; in your prayers.”</p>

<p>He turned and shut himself in with his books.</p>

<p>“You know of this location?”</p>

<p>Henri read to Armand from the address on the
packet.</p>

<p>“Do I know my name? It is the grand boulevard.
And the number&mdash;that, too, is easy.”</p>

<p>Armand knew his Paris.</p>

<p>“March on!” Billy giving mock command.</p>

<p>Reddy’s dream of Paris had first been realized
in the form of a nightmare, but now it ranged to
climax of delight&mdash;the Place de la Concorde, one
of the largest and most elegant squares in Europe;
the Egyptian obelisk; the magnificent Arc de Triomphe;
the column to Napoleon I; the gardens
of the Tuileries; the Louvre; the Art Palace; the
Eiffel tower&mdash;just a few of the beauty spots noted
in the passing on that first day when trouble was
napping.</p>

<p>Armand was not only able to secure one cab,
but had two at his bidding. A wonderful fellow
was Armand, and much given to style.</p>

<p>“Here you are,” he announced with a flourish
to Henri when the cabs drew up before a handsome
residence, with bronze lions crouching on the stone
rests at each side of the entrance.</p>

<p>It was agreed that Henri should enter alone with<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
his precious packet, which delivered and his trust
fulfilled, he would be at liberty to seek his mother
and place in her own hands the Trouville fortune
that had been so hardly won from the iron-bound
chest in the depths of the now ruined château on
the Meuse.</p>

<p>With heart beating high, head erect, and feeling
the responsible charge of a messenger of state,
Henri applied at the entrance for admission, and
as promptly was admitted.</p>

<p>“Wish I had a picture of Henri receiving the
medal for distinguished conduct when he gives up
the packet.”</p>

<p>Billy was back in his habit of expressing funny
thoughts.</p>

<p>“It is not the house of the Premier,” said Armand,
shaking his head. “And the government is
not sitting in Paris now. It is the private residence,
I am sure.”</p>

<p>“The private residence” is the French way of
saying that you just don’t know who does live
there.</p>

<p>The minutes passed, and then the half hour.</p>

<p>“I’m glad,” remarked Billy, “that these are not
taxicabs. If they were we would have to lighten
these belts to pay out.”</p>

<p>“There he is now!” Jimmy had sighted Henri
coming out of the house. Then:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[189]</span></p>

<p>“Why, he looks like he had just fallen off a
Christmas tree.”</p>

<p>Henri certainly did look as if some great joy
had crowned him.</p>

<p>“Boys, that sealed packet was all a frame-up,
arranged by Captain Johnson and that splendid
gentleman at Calais. But it is simply the finest
kind of a frame-up that you could imagine.”</p>

<p>Henri reached out his hands to his comrades
lolling in the cab.</p>

<p>“Come, climb out.”</p>

<p>Then to Armand:</p>

<p>“My friend, I thank you for your good company
and your good service. No&mdash;not a word.”</p>

<p>Henri had slipped something into Armand’s
hand.</p>

<p>As the cabs rolled away, Henri marshaled his
friends to the lion-guarded entrance of the house.</p>

<p>The aforesaid friends were almost bursting with
curiosity.</p>

<p>“Give us the tip.”</p>

<p>Billy prodded Henri with his elbow.</p>

<p>“You’ll know soon enough,” was the unsatisfactory
reply.</p>

<p>Henri led the way into the drawing-room at
the left of the entrance.</p>

<p>Standing there to greet them was a queenly tall
gentlewoman with one of the most sadly sweet<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
faces that the friends of Henri had ever looked
upon.</p>

<p>In courtesy to the American and the English
boy she addressed them in the language they understood,
somewhat haltingly, it is true, but so
graciously that they felt completely at their ease.</p>

<p>“So you are the brave ones who were with my
boy in his every hour of peril. Would that I could
say all that I feel.”</p>

<p>It was Henri’s mother!</p>

<p>“Now you see to whom the sealed packet led me.”</p>

<p>Henri, drawn within his mother’s arm, went on
to tell of the surprise that met him when he first
entered the house.</p>

<p>“I was expecting to be ushered into the presence
of some stern-faced statesman, to hand him
this packet with a bow; then to receive some word
of approbation; and, then, to hurry out and hunt
for mother.</p>

<p>“Instead of the ‘stern-faced statesman’ you now
know whom I found. The packet was addressed
to C. Giraud. My mother’s maiden name was
Clementine Giraud. I never thought of putting
the two together; indeed, I never even noted the
name&mdash;only the street and number. The oldest
friend of our family at Calais in this important
looking document, with its seals and ribbons, merely
extended his compliments to Madame Trouville, and
wished her joy of his messenger. And another<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
thing, it provided the captain with authority to land
us at Havre. Wasn’t that a dandy frame-up?”</p>

<p>Without another word each of the three boys
faced about, unbuckled and pulled the treasure
belt from beneath his blouse. Noting the action,
Henri did likewise.</p>

<p>Then, gently guiding his mother to a chair,
where he enthroned her as a queen, he laid the
four belts in her lap.</p>

<p>The Trouville fortune had been saved!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIX" class="no-break">CHAPTER XXXIX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE CALL OF THE AIR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The call of the air and action was again insistent.
Our Aviator Boys grew restless with leisure,
though it could be imagined that they had
well earned a season of rest. Only the regret
of Henri to leave his mother held them quiet
even so long as a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>As to Jimmy, he was hankering for submarine
service, and only Reddy had the Paris fever. He
wanted to live out his dream.</p>

<p>What a gala occasion it was, then, the day that
Captain Johnson and Josiah Freeman pressed with
their brogans the pavement of Rue de Rivoli, and
brought the news that another brand new sea-plane<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
had slapped the face of the Seine two hours
previous.</p>

<p>“The testing and exhibition work has grown a
little too much for Uncle Josh and myself,” was
the captain’s first after-dinner remark, when
Madame Trouville had laughingly accorded him the
privilege of smoking a cigarette. Henri and Billy
did most of the laughing, however, when the captain
really tackled the cigarette.</p>

<p>“As I was saying,” went on the captain, “it is
not in the pins that we can train two of the planes
at the same time&mdash;and we have three now in the
hangars at Dover that must have our warrant.
Now I know,” waxing confidential, “a pair of
likely young men who could, with a reminder or
two, fill the bill to perfection.”</p>

<p>“Are they at present in France?”</p>

<p>Henri passing the wink to Billy.</p>

<p>“Oh, go on there, now,” bluffed the captain.</p>

<p>“I know who you mean,” clamored Jimmy, who
at times was seriously English.</p>

<p>“You’re a genius, my boy,” put in Josh.</p>

<p>“Well, and out with it, the very boys are here,
and guying their old friend for attempting suicide
with a cigarette.”</p>

<p>“Is it a go?”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>One voice from both Henri and Billy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[193]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose it will have to be,” sighed Madame
Trouville.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, mother,” Henri meekly submitting
to the hair-stroking process, “we’ll never get
hurt if we keep off the ground.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way for an aviator to talk.”</p>

<p>The captain’s approval was hearty.</p>

<p>“It’s in the morning, my boys, that the good
airship leaves for Dover.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll get a lift, won’t I?”</p>

<p>“You’ll be set down in Dover, Jimmy, as sure
as shooting. How about this youngster?” turning
to Reddy.</p>

<p>“He has enlisted as guard for mother,” explained
Henri. “You can’t tear him away from Paris.”</p>

<p>“Good-night all,” said the captain, making a
move to go, after signal to Josh.</p>

<p>“But you’re going to stay here to-night,” urged
Henri.</p>

<p>“No, thank you, my boy, Freeman and I have the
‘plane’ to look after, and we’re not used to gilded
beds, anyhow.”</p>

<p>The truth of the matter was the captain and
Josh had each a blackened briar pipe in his pocket
that would have spoiled before morning.</p>

<p>Gilbert was among the crowd that had assembled
at the river front the next morning to see the big
airship make its getaway.</p>

<p>He was made an honored guest aboard the craft<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
and was greatly impressed with the tremendous
power stored in the sea-plane.</p>

<p>“It is a big advance over anything I have ever
seen in this construction, and, think of it, a ship
within a ship.”</p>

<p>The great airman had parting words with Henri
and Billy:</p>

<p>“If you ever have the notion to fly for France,
the wireless will be all too slow to bring me the
word.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the sea-plane was in full flight.</p>

<p>On this trip Captain Johnson and Engineer
Freeman joined Jimmy in the passenger list.
Billy was at the wheel and Henri at the motor
end.</p>

<p>This was the order until the sea-plane finally
took to its floats in Dover harbor.</p>

<p>“You have won your certificates as English air
navigators. My word and my hand on it.”</p>

<p>The captain spoke the word but he used his hand
to slap the boys between the shoulders.</p>

<p>“Now, my young submarinist, I don’t suppose
you’re going to let us teach you the business.”</p>

<p>“I guess not, captain; I think I prefer the other
game, though you’ve got a good one. I hate to
quit the band, though, I tell you.”</p>

<p>Jimmy looked for a minute like he was going
to cry.</p>

<p>Henri and Billy made a show of being cheerful<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
to help Jimmy out, but it was not much of a success.</p>

<p>“Look alive, youngsters, you’ll be running together
in Dover right along.”</p>

<p>The captain was a good sympathizer.</p>

<p>It was a long time thereafter, however, until
the band was reunited, for the submarine boy went
north in a torpedo boat destroyer, and our Aviator
Boys went&mdash;but that’s another story.</p>

<p>For several weeks the boys&mdash;only two of them
now&mdash;listened to daily lectures from the captain
and Freeman on the fine points of sea-planing.</p>

<p>“You must remember that you are going to be
demonstrators and instructors&mdash;you’re not just
plain aviators any more,” jollied the captain.</p>

<p>“When you go out alone in the cold world&mdash;aloft
I mean&mdash;it is just as well to know just what
to do in any weather. You may never have a
chance to correct an error if it occurs five thousand
feet from nowhere.”</p>

<p>The boys evidently never forgot the captain’s
advice, for they lived to report all the mistakes
they made.</p>

<p>Day after day the young airmen drilled as pilot
and engineer, one time in one position, and one
time in another, change about. Billy was regular
as pilot, but the captain insisted that each could
take the place of the other if emergency demanded.</p>

<p>“You are both qualified for aëroplane work, fore<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
and aft, but you must remember that a sea-plane
is a bigger proposition, and I want you to be top-notchers.
You get me?”</p>

<p>“We ought to be able to get you, captain, for
this is the eighty-eighth time this week that you
have said the same thing.”</p>

<p>“All right, Billy, I’m stopping on the eighty-eighth.
I think you’ll both do.”</p>

<p>The next day the boys were ordered to speed
a sea-plane to London.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XL" class="no-break">CHAPTER XL.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">CAPTURED BY THE GERMANS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>One fine morning a great airship was discovered
by Londoners floating over the Admiralty Arch.
Now it was well known that guns had been mounted
on the Admiralty Arch and on the roof of the
War Office and several of the other larger buildings.
The purpose of these guns was, of course,
to repel hostile airships, about which London had
become decidedly nervous.</p>

<p>These guns, however, had no occasion to bang
at this aërial visitor, for it was known by those
on the inside that this craft was not going to
drop any bombs on the big town, but simply, on
order, drop itself into the Thames, which in navigable<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
importance has been pronounced the greatest
river in the world.</p>

<p>There was no doubt many a hysterical outburst
regarding the big aircraft, but as nothing
was blown up during its hovering period, there
was consequently nothing to tell a policeman about.</p>

<p>This particular airship was conducted by our
Aviator Boys&mdash;Billy Barry and Henri Trouville,
or Henri Trouville and Billy Barry, as you please,
according to who was at the wheel. It happened
that Billy was working his regular trick as pilot
on this London visit, and it was the first journey
of importance that Henri and himself had been
in sole command of a sea-plane&mdash;the largest of its
kind.</p>

<p>It being a peaceful or commercial mission, there
was no gunner in the bow, and no wireless operator
sat in the center of the hull. Just Billy, fore,
and Henri, aft. A small crew, but a crew trained
to the minute.</p>

<p>The sea-plane, by signal, took to the river a short
distance below London Bridge, in the dock region,
where there was a total water area of some 600
acres.</p>

<p>On the occasion of the official visit to the sea-plane,
as it floated near the docks, the inspecting
officers, one and all, looked their astonishment upon
the size of the crew, physically as well as in point
of number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[198]</span></p>

<p>They looked at the craft and they looked at
the boys and they looked at each other.</p>

<p>But when the crew took up the matter of detail
and explanation, so thorough was the review they
gave, that the officers ceased to wonder that these
agents had been selected and entrusted with so
much responsibility.</p>

<p>“This is about the only thing we do not have
occasion to handle in this craft,” said Billy, as
he swiveled in all directions the machine gun in
the bow.</p>

<p>“It’s a handy little barker,” observed one of the
officers, who evidently knew all about guns.</p>

<p>Having completed their inspection and notes, a
senior officer asked Billy if the crew went with
the craft.</p>

<p>“Until it is sold, only,” was Billy’s prompt reply.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” added the officer, “that we can’t have
you in the balance.”</p>

<p>“We have traveled with three fighting flags
since we have been flying around on this side of
the ocean. It keeps us guessing what will be the
next.”</p>

<p>Henri was repeating what he had said to the
captain just before leaving Dover.</p>

<p>“Have an eye out, or the Germans will get you
yet,” smilingly warned the senior officer.</p>

<p>“Who knows?” thought Billy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[199]</span></p>

<p>The inspecting officers extended the freedom of
the town to the young aviators, but it was necessary
for them to return to Dover immediately, and
having assurance that there had been nothing left
undone connected with their mission, they took
flight that afternoon, fixing their course from the
dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral, the most conspicuous
building in the metropolis.</p>

<p>When they reached Dover the captain had a story
that a few days ago one of the destroyers had
picked a German sea-plane out of the channel
waters off Harwich, and it had been announced
that it carried a freight of bombs, which were
destroyed. The two men who formed its crew had
blandly refused to give any information as to their
plans.</p>

<p>“And while I can’t swear to the story,” averred
the captain, “it gave me some worry about you.
That kind of thing is pretty close.”</p>

<p>“Never saw another thing in the air that could
catch us,” chirruped Billy.</p>

<p>“Don’t you go to singing yourself into the idea
that your ship is the only thing afloat, my boy.
The Germans have a few good birds themselves.”</p>

<p>The captain never figured out of reason.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri soon after had an experience
above the Straits which convinced them that they
were not the only speeders on the course, and confirmed
the captain’s opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[200]</span></p>

<p>They had been flying through a North Sea mist
and had just lifted to a clearing when Billy, peering
sideways around the rising bow, saw the nose
of another airship dart out from the sheltering mist.
Sharp around Billy twisted the wheel to save collision,
and endeavored to swing away from the
intended attack of the German crew. Henri set
the engines to their maximum power, but it was
too late to avoid the shot from the fore gun of
the opposing aircraft. There was a ripping and
rending of rods and stays. Billy turned the planes
for the fall, and down they went, their stricken
craft helpless and beyond control.</p>

<p>Striking the water, the damaged seaplane settled
like a bird with a broken wing.</p>

<p>The craft from which the shot had been fired
dived down to complete a capture, and Billy and
Henri, seeing the folly of attempting to resist a
stalwart crew of four, promptly surrendered.</p>

<p>“You ought to be spanked and put to bed, you
naughty boys,” admonished the giant pilot of the
German craft, when he noted the youth of his captives.</p>

<p>“But I guess you are smart enough,” he admitted,
“or you could not have made the play you did
to get away. If it had not been for the gun we
might have been fooled.</p>

<p>“Give them room there, Franz, maybe we can
find places for them in the service.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[201]</span></p>

<p>So they climbed aboard the big German flyer
without a word, fully determined, however, that
they would not enter the service of Germany any
more than they had entered the service of England
and France; but very thankful to the good-natured
Teutons who had rescued them after plunging them
into the sea.</p>

<p>Captain Johnson watched for his flying boys in
vain, and when at last the wrecked seaplane was
towed in from the North Sea by an English vessel
he gave them up for lost.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XLI" class="no-break">CHAPTER XLI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE BOYS PUT ON THE GRAY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When our Aviator Boys had been crowded into
small space aboard the German seaplane, the big
flyer cut through the mist at top speed. The capture
of the young airmen had been but an incident;
an accident, indeed. The German aviators
were playing a bigger game. The boys heard the
man called Franz jesting with his comrades about
something that was going to spit fire like a volcano
upon the English. Henri, in soft aside tones,
let Billy know what it was all about, for Billy was
as short in German as he was in the French language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[202]</span></p>

<p>The seaplane gunner (they called him Joseph),
when the machine soared above the mist line, kept
a sharp lookout through field glasses for some expected
coming over the sea.</p>

<p>The boys could see, now that it was clearing to
the north, the familiar trend of the English coast.</p>

<p>“They’re up to something, that’s sure,” whispered
Henri to Billy; “but what it is I haven’t the
least idea.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any bombs in this craft, so it can’t
be anything like a blow-up from above,” was Billy’s
whispered reply.</p>

<p>“Hold your mouths,” growled the giant pilot.</p>

<p>Henri put a warning finger on his lips, glancing
at Billy.</p>

<p>Gunner Joseph had evidently sighted the something
for which he had been looking, for he made
a rapid motion with a hand behind him, which the
pilot evidently understood, for he immediately
changed the direct northerly course of the seaplane
sharply to the northeast.</p>

<p>Now visible to the naked eye was a fleet of
cruisers, under full head of steam, and as they
swiftly approached, the black cross in the flapping
colors proclaimed the Kaiser’s warships.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri were astounded at the sight. A
German fleet within easy shelling distance of the
Yorkshire coast!</p>

<p>One of the cruisers turned broadside, and from<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
the armored hull belched smoke and flame. Looking
down upon the town of Hartlepool, the boys saw
buildings crumple like houses of cards before a
gale. Other vessels of the war fleet followed the
leader in broadsides, and every iron cast seemed
to find a mark and exacted toll of death and destruction.
The Hartlepools, Whitby, and Scarborough,
places well known to the captive aviators,
were under galling fire for an hour.</p>

<p>“They’re shooting a mile, but look how true
they get the range,” remarked Billy in Henri’s nearest
ear.</p>

<p>“Look!” Henri pointed to the land batteries,
now spouting fiery responses.</p>

<p>The German fleet was speeding northward&mdash;the
hovering seaplane giving signal that the British patrolling
squadron was hastening to cut off the invading
vessels. Now favored by the gathering mist
in the northerly flight, the daring raiders made
their escape, but it could be seen that one of the
lighter cruisers was afire. The land batteries had
evidently scored a target or two.</p>

<p>A guttural command from the man in the sea-plane’s
bow, and the machine was set in the wake
of the fleet, and with full power in the motors.</p>

<p>“How much of the oil feed have we?”</p>

<p>The gunner’s question was passed back from
mouth to mouth to the engine man, for in the noises<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
of the high speed nothing else could be heard beyond
a foot or two.</p>

<p>“Hundred miles or so,” was the answer of the
engine man, passed forward.</p>

<p>“And nearly four hundred miles to Kiel,” muttered
the gunner. “But the fleet will put us right,”
he satisfied himself.</p>

<p>So they were bound for Kiel, and the boys did
not know it until the seaplane settled among the
German cruisers churning the waves in their race
for home. With tanks refilled, the aircraft led the
flight to Helgoland Bay.</p>

<p>While far in advance of the warships, the sea-plane
drew the fire of an English submarine that
suddenly rose from the depths of the sea. A figure
jumped from the turret of the underwater craft,
turned a lever, and the gun that was folded into
the back of the submarine swung muzzle upward.
Once, twice, thrice, the gun cracked, but every shot
a miss.</p>

<p>The third shot, however, was a near one, for
Billy and Henri, interested spectators from the
steel gallery, heard the ball hiss in the passing.</p>

<p>The lookout man of the seaplane trailed a signal
to the fleet, but the submarine had disappeared
before the cruisers had warily crossed the danger
spot indicated by the seaplane.</p>

<p>“It would have been good-by if we had caught<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
that solid shot in the business section of this ship,”
was Billy’s essay to the stolid pilot in front of him.</p>

<p>If the pilot heard or understood, he did not
condescend to answer.</p>

<p>Some forty miles from the German naval stations
in the neighborhood of Helgoland, the sea-plane’s
own gun was swiveled in the direction of
a darting aëroplane scouting from some English
warship, on the watch in these waters, but when
the machine guns on one of the German cruisers,
adapted to high-angle fire, broke loose on the British
machine, it turned tail at a speed of seventy
miles an hour.</p>

<p>Franz appeared to be greatly amused at this,
and started a rapid flow of German humor about
the high-dodging machines made somewhere else
than in Germany.</p>

<p>Henri did not tell Billy what all the fun was
about, for fear of bringing Billy to his feet with
an argument as to where the best flying machines
were made. But it would not have made any difference,
for Franz and Billy were both assured
of personal peace, in that neither could understand
the other, though they talked until doomsday.</p>

<p>The boys had no fixed idea as to what fate had
in store for them on German soil.</p>

<p>“I do hope that it won’t be a military fortress
for us,” said Henri. “It would be mighty rough<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
luck to be locked up at Cologne, or some other
jail of a place.”</p>

<p>“But you remember the pilot said when we were
caught that they might find a place for us in the
aviation service.”</p>

<p>Billy found comfort in that memory.</p>

<p>“If I couldn’t have anything else to do but carry
oil around a hangar,” asserted Henri, “it would
sure be away ahead of looking at the stone walls
of a fortress.”</p>

<p>It was a happy moment, then, for our Aviator
Boys when at Helgoland they were told by the
giant pilot of the seaplane, whose name proved to
be Carl, that they were booked, not now for Kiel,
but Hamburg, which was the center of great aircraft
activity.</p>

<p>“No dungeon deep for us,” sang Billy, as he executed
a clog step on the deck of the boat that later
was taking them up the great river Elbe to one of
the most remarkable cities of Germany.</p>

<p>“An aircraft town for sure,” cried Henri, when,
with Carl as kindly captor and guide, Billy and
himself fared forth from the docks into the streets
of Hamburg.</p>

<p>In an hour the boys saw eleven sheds, each said
to contain a Zeppelin, and at the air camp all manner
and makes of aëroplanes were housed.</p>

<p>It was here that Carl presented his charges to
Heinrich Hume, aviation lieutenant, who conducted<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
the new recruits to a mammoth canvas house, where
both aëroplanes and aëroplanists rest, when there
is a chance to rest.</p>

<p>Billy had another pleasurable shock when Lieutenant
Hume, in good old English, abruptly told
Henri and himself to shake themselves out of their
blue flannel outfits, and dive into a big camp chest
filled with clothing of the lead color.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind the blue,” advised the lieutenant,
“but it doesn’t mate with the other moving pictures
here.”</p>

<p>“We don’t have to be sworn in, or anything like
that?” anxiously inquired Billy.</p>

<p>“You’re more likely to be sworn at than in,”
laughed the lieutenant. “Now to the point: Do
you know enough about aëroplanes to roll one with
the right end foremost? Carl says you kids were
working an armored seaplane when they plugged
you, but Carl is sometimes inclined to draw the
long bow about adventures in which he has figured.”</p>

<p>Billy was inclined to hump his back at this, but
wisely concluded to let action stand as the proof.</p>

<p>When Billy and Henri went to work among the
’planes, the apprentices under training by Lieutenant
Hume looked like the oft-quoted thirty cents.
One or two of them even looked daggers at the
newcomers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[208]</span></p>

<p>At the end of the first day of the boys’ service
test, the lieutenant said to himself:</p>

<p>“Carl has stumbled against the real thing, for
once, at least.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XLII" class="no-break">CHAPTER XLII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">FOUGHT TO THE FINISH.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The boys awaited patiently an invitation from
the lieutenant to exhibit their skill by upper-air
exercise in one of the Taubes&mdash;the Germans called
their military monoplanes doves&mdash;but that officer
did not seem then inclined to favor one of the aviation
field helpers above another.</p>

<p>A shock-headed boy, hailed as Max, who had
been an ironworker in Bremen, showed a decided
disposition to “pick upon” Henri and Billy in their
daily occupation of valeting the aircraft.</p>

<p>He was nursing a jealous spirit, aroused by a
chance word of praise bestowed upon our Aviator
Boys by Lieutenant Hume, and tried to enlist
the sympathy of the other employees of the hangars
in common cause against the “fancy fellows,”
as he persisted in calling the newcomers. But as
a rule they were a good-natured lot, and not inclined
to worry about anything except a food shortage
at meal time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[209]</span></p>

<p>Max, before our boys had arrived, had claimed
rank as first among those serving the more noted
aviators, who were constantly coming and going.</p>

<p>The climax of wrath with Max came when Ingold,
the great aviator, starting for the war zone,
dispensed with his clumsy services and accepted
those of Billy and Henri in overhauling a double-decker,
or biplane, that was to be used in active
military movement.</p>

<p>“You’ll get a cracked head for this,” hissed Max,
when the lieutenant and the big airman had passed
out of hearing.</p>

<p>Billy, to whom the threat was addressed, did not
understand the words, but he guessed from the attitude
of the threatener that something ugly was
intended.</p>

<p>So Billy, who never counted fear a burden worth
the bother, simply grinned, turned, and went on
with his work of tuning the biplane.</p>

<p>Henri, tinkering at the motor end of the machine,
looked up just in time to see Max, wrench
in hand, poised to strike at the back of Billy’s head.</p>

<p>“Look out, Billy!”</p>

<p>The warning cry from Henri saved Billy from
a stunning blow on the head, but he caught the
jolt from the wrench on his right shoulder, as he
swiftly faced about.</p>

<p>With a good left uninjured, however, Billy gave
Max a short-arm jab in the neck, at the chin, that<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
tumbled the would-be slugger upon the packed earth
floor of the hangar.</p>

<p>“Good arm!” exclaimed Henri. “But how about
the other?”</p>

<p>With the question, Henri gently worked his comrade’s
right arm up and down to see if there was
any hitch in the shoulder where the wrench had
landed.</p>

<p>“Not a chance for a surgeon,” assured Billy.
“Just a little numb&mdash;that’s all.”</p>

<p>Max slowly gathered himself up from the
ground, with a hand on his jaw, and a vicious glitter
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“It will be to the finish next time.”</p>

<p>His tone was full of menace.</p>

<p>“What’s he saying?” inquired Billy.</p>

<p>Henri translated.</p>

<p>“Tell him,” said Billy, “that the day and the
hour is his very own to name, so long as he comes
in the front way.”</p>

<p>Henri did not comply with this request, but
hooked arms with Billy, and walked him away.</p>

<p>This was the glove in the ring that led to one
of the liveliest lightweight come-togethers that the
aviation camp boys had ever witnessed.</p>

<p>Neither Henri nor Billy had mentioned the
wrench incident to the lieutenant. They were too
self-reliant for that kind of business. There was<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
nothing, either, to induce Max to relate his sorry
part in the hangar scrap.</p>

<p>It was not until several days later that Henri
was approached by a lad with the name handle of
Jacob. The latter was apparently not a willing
messenger.</p>

<p>“Max wants a fight with your friend,” he explained,
“and if it was me he couldn’t get it, for
he’s a tricky one and as strong as a bull. But I
just had to do this to get rid of him.”</p>

<p>“You tell that fellow that we don’t want anything
to do with him,” was Henri’s message to the
challenger.</p>

<p>The next morning, while many of the machines
were aloft in practice and test flights, and the aviation
helpers were grouped at the far end of the
parade ground, Max deliberately called Billy an
unbearable name, and followed the insult with a
ringing slap on the cheek of the boy from Bangor.</p>

<p>The fat was in the fire!</p>

<p>Instantly the circle widened, and in the center
two husky youngsters went at it hammer and tongs.</p>

<p>There were no gloves, no seconds, and no referee
with rules up his sleeve.</p>

<p>Billy ruled a strong favorite, but Henri alone
made a noise about it, for the others were reluctant
to take a chance of offending Max, unless they were
assured in advance that he was going to be thoroughly
whipped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[212]</span></p>

<p>It certainly did not appear that way in the opening
of the bout, for Max had gashed Billy’s forehead
with a full knuckle blow, and also landed a
rib-cracker on the latter’s body.</p>

<p>Billy now sparred warily, seeking time to recover
from the body blow, which had proved the
most serious, though the bleeding bruise on the
forehead made the most show of injury.</p>

<p>He kept his antagonist on the move, at the same
time keeping out of range of the fists swinging like
windmills. Max had the strength, and a certain
skill as a rough-and-tumble fighter, but he also had
too much flesh on his bones, and little science as a
boxer.</p>

<p>Billy was as clean built as a greyhound, muscled
like a young gladiator, and learned where to hit
and how to hit under an old master of the craft in
Boston.</p>

<p>“Take your time, Billy,” encouraged Henri, “he’s
a beef, and you’ll get him all right.”</p>

<p>Henri’s blood was running warm at the sight
of his chum’s bruised face, and he would have violently
resented any attempt to interfere in what he
firmly believed would result in payment in full by
the loose fighter who had provoked the battle and
inflicted first injury.</p>

<p>Max began to exhibit distress from his exertions,
which had ceased to count since the opening onslaught.
He struck hard, but he struck at random.<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
Enraged at the useless and wearing practice of hitting
at something where it was not, the panting
slugger made the break to get under Billy’s guard
and clinch. It was a grievous error for him.</p>

<p>Billy, keen-eyed, caught him coming, and nothing
but daylight between a ready fist and the knockout
point of a square chin.</p>

<p>Biff! There was everything behind that blow in
the way of steam.</p>

<p>The Bremen lad had been coming too fast for
the impact to hurl him backward. He simply
sagged at the knees, and dropped in a heap.</p>

<p>The fight was over, but not all of the trouble.
Billy rushed to the side of his fallen foe, who,
showing the whites of his eyes and rattling the
breath in his throat, was viewed with alarm by the
witnesses of the exciting mill.</p>

<p>“Give him air,” hoarsely urged the victor to the
crowding white faces.</p>

<p>Henri ran to a platform nearby where water
buckets were placed, and the chums gave all of the
first aid in their experience to the vanquished.</p>

<p>Max, directly, recovered consciousness, and
raised his head and dazedly looked about him.
Finding that his head was pillowed in Billy’s lap,
Max struggled to free himself from the sheltering
embrace of the arm that put him down and out.</p>

<p>Recovering speech, the way he expressed his chagrin<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
and humiliation was enough to make the air
blue.</p>

<p>Jacob told him that he ought to be satisfied now,
and Billy offered truce by extended hand. Max,
however, was far from the mood that finds any
consolation in defeat.</p>

<p>“Here comes the lieutenant,” announced Henri;
“we’d better skip, Billy, and patch up that face
of yours before we are put on the question rack.”</p>

<p>All the boys scattered in pairs, or several more
together, except Max, and he walked alone, brooding,
sullen, and implacable.</p>

<p>Billy had been washed clean of blood and holding
a washer-plate of cold steel against the bump
on his forehead, when Jacob came into the hangar
with the information that the lieutenant had been
calling for his pair of late recruits, and wanted
them forthwith.</p>

<p>“He’s heard about the fight,” was Henri’s first
surmise.</p>

<p>“Do I look like a pug?” Billy inquired, lifting the
plate from the bruised spot.</p>

<p>“You will likely go into training on bread and
water,” gloomily predicted Henri.</p>

<p>“Oh, quit croaking,” advised Billy. “Come
ahead, and we’ll take the medicine, whatever it is.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant was framed in the flaps of his
canvas house when the boys presented themselves
for supposed correction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[215]</span></p>

<p>The officer calmly inspected the recruits through
the smoke that wreathed around the bowl of his
meerschaum.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XLIII" class="no-break">CHAPTER XLIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">SETTING OF A DEATH TRAP.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“I’ve been getting a line on you.”</p>

<p>When the lieutenant delivered himself thusly the
boys were sure and positive that he had all the details
of the fight, and wonder only was left as to
how serious a breach of discipline the officer would
consider a battering match on the parade ground.</p>

<p>What was their surprise, then, when the lieutenant
went on to say, aiming the stem of his meerschaum
at a group of officers&mdash;high officers apparently&mdash;which
at the moment made a ground circle
of slim, polished boots about a Zeppelin taking
in its flying cargo of gas:</p>

<p>“Colonel Muller, over there, has just been telling
me the story of a couple of boys he met
in America who beat anything of the age in the
matter of expert flying. I mentioned that the crew
of one of our seaplanes had picked up a pair of
kids who, they claimed, were navigating alone in
an airship big enough to keep the best of them
guessing. The colonel has expressed a wish to
look you over. He’s great for aviation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[216]</span></p>

<p>“Gee! I believe that this Muller was with
Colonel McCready when we made that record flight
in Texas. You remember, the tall one, with the
monocle, and hair and mustache the color of a
ten-dollar gold piece.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant had walked down the canvas row
to ascertain the further wishes of the colonel, giving
Billy this chance to search the memories of his
chum and himself.</p>

<p>“Come to think of it,” replied Henri, “I do recall
seeing a man like that, but it is no sure shot
that it is the same one.”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon know, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Billy saw the lieutenant raise a beckoning finger,
and the boys hurried to present themselves.</p>

<p>Facing Colonel Muller, the boys, in their ill-fitting
gray tunics and rawhide boots, hardly hoped
for recognition. They knew their man in an instant.</p>

<p>The colonel had a long memory, too, for he immediately
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Hello there, Boy Aviators, as Colonel ‘Mac’
called you; you’re a long way from home, I see.”</p>

<p>It was a matter of pride and satisfaction to the
boys that the big soldier could place them, even in
the disguise of an aviation camp outfit.</p>

<p>Turning to the lieutenant, the colonel inquired:
“Have you put these youngsters through the paces
yet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[217]</span></p>

<p>“No, colonel,” replied the lieutenant, “they have
been working in the oil-can brigade chiefly, but
from the way they handle the parts I suspected they
were out of the apprentice class.”</p>

<p>“Why, they are builders as well as demonstrators,”
explained the colonel. “Teach them anything
about aircraft? I guess not.”</p>

<p>By this time all of the officers were sizing up
the objects of the colonel’s unusual comment.</p>

<p>The helpers, with open mouths, had gathered at
a respectful distance, but near enough to hear what
was going on, and marveled that the great colonel
should condescend to familiar terms with boys
whom they claimed as of their class and number.
Max, the malignant, was in the front row, and none
the happier for the new honors conferred upon the
fellow-workers whose very presence galled him.</p>

<p>“Trim them up a bit,” said the colonel to the
lieutenant, pointing to the slop-chest clothing in
which the boys were attired, “and send them over
to headquarters this evening.”</p>

<p>“You’ve made a ten strike,” observed the lieutenant,
as he sent the boys to a military clothier
in the town with a written rush order.</p>

<p>“We could register from Annapolis now and
get across with it,” laughed Billy, as they awaited
the pleasure of an orderly at headquarters. The
boys had been “trimmed up a bit,” and neatly
garbed in gray looked as fine as middies on parade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[218]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, here you are; come in,” invited the colonel.
“Gentlemen,” turning to others in the room, “here
are the young airmen about whom I was talking.
This aviation business, I confess, is a hobby with
me. Why, just think of boys this age not only
able to completely assemble one of these wonderful
machines, but to drive them, under ordinary circumstances,
so expertly that safety aloft is about
as equally assured as in a railway journey.</p>

<p>“Behold one of the natural enemies of your
craft,” continued the colonel, directing the boys’
attention to a smart-looking young soldier, a lean,
keen fellow, with captain’s straps, lounging on a
sofa nearby. “He’s a fellow who turns balloon
cannon loose on about every plane that hasn’t a
black cross on its yellow stomach. That’s one of
the reasons why a military aviator would have as
much chance of getting life insurance at Lloyd’s
as would a snowball of holding together in the furnace
room of a cruiser.”</p>

<p>“We’ve seen some of the steel noses turned up
at us,” volunteered Billy.</p>

<p>“Don’t believe they were exactly of my kind,”
interposed the gunman on the lounge. “These are
new ones, just out, and they reach further than any
other make. We can haul them around at the tail
of an automobile at the speed of about sixty miles
an hour. Come along when we pull out of here<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
and I’ll show you what a spin of a wheel will do
in aiming the little daisy on the steel truck.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let him ever catch you asleep on your
perch,” joked the colonel, “or there will be a bird
funeral in the aviation family.”</p>

<p>When the lieutenant passed the word among the
helpers to hustle the aëroplane shipment, it was noticeable
that Billy and Henri served no longer in
the pulling and hauling end of the job. They were
held at the elbow of the directing force, and vested
with the power to give orders in the hangar instead
of taking them. This change of class met with no
rebellion among the apprentices, for they reckoned
that the newcomers must be of extraordinary ability
to be so quickly advanced, and, further, it was
soon recognized that even the lieutenant had no
aircraft knowledge superior to his young assistants.</p>

<p>“I believe,” acknowledged this officer, “that I
have you beaten in only one branch of the profession,
the Zeppelin branch, I mean, and that, I suppose,
is only due to the fact that this invention is
exclusively German.”</p>

<p>“That’s mighty kind of you to say this,” returned
Henri, “but Billy and I feel that you can
yet set us straight on a good many points in these
foreign planes, and we would be glad to have a
chance to dig into Zeppelin instruction.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that last,” was the uncertain
answer of the lieutenant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[220]</span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Max, I wonder,” observed
Henri, as the last crate of the shipment was
rolled down to the docks; “he must be raising a pair
of wings on his shoulders.”</p>

<p>“If you had seen the side glance he gave me to-day,
you would leave the wings out of your calculations.”</p>

<p>Billy felt that Max quiet was more to be feared
than Max boisterous.</p>

<p>“Sorry to see Colonel Muller leave, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“So was I, Henri; but he said that only a bullet
would prevent our meeting again.”</p>

<p>The colonel had also told Billy that Henri and
himself had only entered the side door of Germany,
and there was a big chance of their seeing more
of the country.</p>

<p>Among the several satisfactory results of their
reunion with the colonel, one bobbed up that very
afternoon, when Lieutenant Hume stated that a
new lot of machines were to be set up and jockeyed,
and, as nearly all of the aviators had gone with
the last shipment, the boys could take a turn in the
air every day, if they so desired.</p>

<p>“If they desired!” Did thirsty ducks need a second
invitation to visit a pond?</p>

<p>As there were no double-deckers, or biplanes,
in the fresh invoice, Billy and Henri were to work
separately in the war monoplanes, those with the<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
birdlike wings and curved tail rudder piece, the
smaller birds that whirred and whined.</p>

<p>Two of these machines had been carefully
groomed and set in order for an early morning
flight, and the boys retired with all the assurance
in the world that they could give the helpers such
a practical illustration of scientific planing that
there would remain no doubt in the minds of these
groundlings as to the merit and right of the newcomers’
promotion.</p>

<p>Silence reigned in the house of canvas, and no
hostiles to guard against, sentinels were not stationed,
and only occasional inspection required during
the night.</p>

<p>It was midnight. Stealthy hands parted the flaps
of the entrance to the big tent, and a stocky figure,
but light-footed, darted across the floor of hardened
clay to the stalls where the monoplanes were
set for motion.</p>

<p>An electric light tube flashed into a box of tools,
and the intruder was speedily operating with a
chisel at the propeller end of the monoplane, in
which was placed the repair kit, numbered 16&mdash;charged
in the hangar record to one Billy Barry.</p>

<p>The furtive visitor, apparently satisfied that he
had accomplished his purpose, replaced the chisel
and closed the tool box. He took the further precaution
of picking up every chip or shaving that
had dropped during the use of the chisel edge.<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
Then, with a final sweep of the electric tube, the
stocky shape flitted through the canvas door into
outer darkness.</p>

<p>Would that there was some warning word in
dreamland to sound in the ear of sleeping Billy
Barry. An assassin hand had set a death trap with
cunning intent to conceal the peril therein until a
moment too late to baffle the devilish design!</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XLIV" class="no-break">CHAPTER XLIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A LIFE IN THE BALANCE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Billy lifted a ruddy face from a bucket of ice-cold
water, in which he had been taking a waking
dip, and then yanked Henri by the heels out of a
warm blanket nest.</p>

<p>“Get up, lazybones, and let’s be scraping the sky.
It’s a good six o’clock, and the cook’s all in a fume
about the breakfast getting cold.”</p>

<p>Henri caught the spirit of his companion, and
both gave way to joyful anticipation of a twenty-mile
dash in a pair of monoplanes.</p>

<p>They attempted to waltz with the cook, but neither
could reach even a quarter way around the
waist of this rotund Wilhelm, and if the latter’s
legs had not been so much shorter than his waistband<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
it is likely that the skylarkers would have received
several jars from a ham-like foot.</p>

<p>Capering like colts, the boys headed for the hangar,
and with the assistance of Jacob and another
helper, early on the ground, the machines were
rolled out to make their buzzing start for high
places.</p>

<p>When Billy had removed kit number 16 from
his monoplane he hopped into his seat on the frame.
Henri was already settled for flight.</p>

<p>The run-off, however, was postponed for a minute
or two so that the aëroplanists could watch the
rise of a Zeppelin directly in front of them.</p>

<p>“Let ’er go,” sang Billy, and both monoplanes
got away together.</p>

<p>The Zeppelin had just swung around in the
great arc of a circle, and the boys in the monoplanes
were sailing immediately above the great
cylinder. Henri had just turned a swift glance at
his companion aviator, with intent of setting the
direction of flight, when&mdash;and the horror of it&mdash;Billy’s
machine suddenly stopped in midair, wabbling
like a cradle, and before the young aviator’s
desperate attempt to retain control could prevail
the machine turned upside down, and the boy from
Bangor hung by the knees from the tumbling frame.</p>

<p>Henri would have cried aloud in agony of spirit&mdash;but
he was as one stricken dumb. He almost<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
spelled death for himself by letting go of the controls
of his machine.</p>

<p>But what a sight for his staring eyes!</p>

<p>The falling monoplane had struck athwart the
aluminum envelope of the Zeppelin, and, though the
bigger craft trembled from stem to stern with the
shock, it held its way, buoyed up by the gas chambers
on each side of the cylinder. Billy soon rested
safely on one of the platforms, cheered by members
of a rejoicing crew.</p>

<p>Henri found his voice again, and, shouting like
a madman, he sent his monoplane darting toward
the earth, and if he failed to land in his usual beautifully
precise way he was there when the Zeppelin
brought back to him that “dear old Billy.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant, hastily responding to summons,
found his two expert aviators hugging one another,
and the crew of the Zeppelin critically inspecting
a damaged monoplane grounded between
its mate and the big ship.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter here?” nervously demanded
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“It looks like foul play is the matter,” shortly
responded the chief officer of the Zeppelin. He
was not a member of Lieutenant Hume’s command.</p>

<p>“You’re right,” exclaimed the lieutenant with an
oath, as he knelt to more closely inspect the chiseled
propeller and the spiked rudder. Turning to
Billy, and in severe manner:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[225]</span></p>

<p>“Do you always hold your life so lightly as to
start an air machine without previous inspection?”</p>

<p>“That machine, sir, was as right as could be when
we left it last night. Indeed, sir, it was in elegant
shape.”</p>

<p>“No question but what some devil in human form
planned your death, and if I get the dastard it will
be a yardarm in the harbor for him, and no waste
of time and lead.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant was aroused, and when a calm
like his was rudely broken it meant woe for the
object of his wrath.</p>

<p>Told of the manner in which Billy had been
saved, the anger of the officer relaxed its force for
the moment, when he solemnly said:</p>

<p>“Of the like I have never known; it is beyond
me.”</p>

<p>Investigation, vigorously pushed, soon developed
a significant fact&mdash;the youth to whom kit 9 was
charged failed to respond at roll call. Max was
missing.</p>

<p>Jacob then blurted out the whole story of the
fight, and all that had preceded and followed it.</p>

<p>“I want to say right here and now,” was the
stern declaration of the lieutenant, “that the next
offender in this camp will get his billet to Cologne,
where they play checkers with their noses on iron
bars. As for Max, if he is captured, you will see<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
an example made that will not rub out of your
memories for many a day.”</p>

<p>With that the speaker’s jaws set like a clamp.</p>

<p>When Billy petitioned for the job of making another
monoplane test the very next day, the lieutenant
was astonished.</p>

<p>“You certainly ought to take something for that
nerve of yours, boy.”</p>

<p>“But, sir, it’s all in the game,” argued Billy;
“it’s our business, and we can’t quit for every close
call.”</p>

<p>“See me to-morrow; besides, Herr Roque wants
to have a talk with you. Here he is now.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant presented Billy to a mild-looking
man in citizen’s attire, and who peered at the boy
through horn-bound spectacles. This noted secret
agent was the picture to-day of a well-to-do merchant
in the lesser lines of trade. What his appearance
would indicate to-morrow is another thing.
He was a lightning change artist, according to repute.</p>

<p>“Glad to meet you, young sir,” was his bland
address, in perfect English.</p>

<p>“Same to you, sir,” Billy politely replied, all the
time wondering what was coming.</p>

<p>“I just came over from the city to take up a
little supply contract with the officers here, and I
learned of your narrow escape from death. It was
wonderful, miraculous. I congratulate you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[227]</span></p>

<p>“Thank you kindly, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah, no need of thanks, young sir. I highly appreciate
the favor of meeting you.</p>

<p>“Let us be seated, if you please. I am not so
young as I used to be. Good. Now we can chat
in comfort. I am very fond of the air sport, I assure
you. Isn’t it queer that often what we admire
the most we know the least about? Art, for
instance&mdash;and flying, too, on little boards, without
the lifting power of gas. Wonderful!”</p>

<p>“What’s he driving at?” thought Billy. Then
aloud: “I expect I had better not take up any more
of your time, sir, as you are here on business.”</p>

<p>“I wish you knew just how dull it was in Hamburg
now. Business is, oh, so quiet. And I so
like to talk to bright young men. It just occurred
to me that you and your young friend would like
to take a little voyage with me, in a trading vessel
that I own. Of course, in these sad times of war
a sea voyage is not the popular choice for recreation,
but just a brief cruise in known waters isn’t
at all bad for the nerves. The regularly enlisted
young men, it seems, cannot be spared, and I have
spoken to the lieutenant about borrowing his young
visitors for a week or two, promising them both a
good time, and just that spice of adventure which
lads of your caliber seem to require.”</p>

<p>“It just occurred” also to Billy that it was more
than passing strange, in the first place, that there<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
should be so much personal interest manifested
in the affairs of Henri and himself, and, secondly,
how it was that an ordinary tradesman could have
such a “pull” with military authority. The civilian
here, as a rule, did not count in high figures alongside
of a uniform.</p>

<p>This was evidently an exceptional case, for not
only did the lieutenant approve of Herr Roque’s
proposition and invitation, but that officer had unbent
to the extent of entertaining Henri, on the side,
and telling him that Billy and himself were lucky
in attracting the interest of this kindly merchant.</p>

<p>So it proved no longer a matter of open consent
on the part of the boys; it was simply a go, when
the lieutenant commanded.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why I was selected as the dummy
for all that beating around the bush,” observed
Billy, when the boys tumbled into their bunks that
night.</p>

<p>“You oughtn’t to kick because you are the prominent
member of the firm,” teased Henri.</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t know what it is until we get
to it, that’s one thing sure,” yawned Billy.</p>

<p>They were booked, if they only knew it, to discover
that “Herr Roque” was a man of many
moods, as well as make-ups.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE WAYS OF THE SECRET SERVICE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“That doesn’t look like a pirate craft, anyhow.”</p>

<p>The boys were on the docks bright and early
the next morning, and were looking at the vessel
in which they were expected to embark within the
next hour for the trip down the Elbe to the sea.</p>

<p>As Billy had put it, the ship they were viewing
was neither “low, long, nor rakish.” Herr Roque
had not deceived them on that point, at least. It
was a “trading vessel.” All of the crew in sight
were of the roustabout class, except the captain,
who was somewhat of a dandy, with a glazed cap,
high collar, military blouse, and corduroy trousers.</p>

<p>“Hi, there!” he called to the boys in high-pitched
German, “are you from Herr Roque?”</p>

<p>Henri advised in loud tone that such was the fact.</p>

<p>“Come aboard, then,” invited the boss of the
deck.</p>

<p>The boys made short work of the rickety gangboard,
and, aboard, cast an eye about for their host.</p>

<p>The captain said something in his way of speaking
that meant “you’ll see him later.”</p>

<p>It was some time later&mdash;at the mouth of the Elbe,
and late at night.</p>

<p>Before this happened, the boys, not experienced<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
as seamen, were surprised to the limit at the ready
transformation of that “trade vessel.” Tarpaulin
coverings removed, like magic unfolding, revealed
a funnel, gunbeds, and guns in them, of the kind
to raise the mischief with a hull at short range;
spars were stripped of clumsy sails, and the craft
generally departed from the peaceful classification
in which it cleared from Hamburg.</p>

<p>“Oh, you pleasure trip!” Billy merrily commented.</p>

<p>“You surely didn’t swallow that story?”</p>

<p>“You know I didn’t, Henri,” returned Billy.
“When is a dummy not a dummy? Answer: When
someone thinks he is what he isn’t. How’s that,
Henri?”</p>

<p>“As good grammar as could be expected on a
trick ship,” acknowledged Henri.</p>

<p>The sailors even changed their faces with their
clothes, their jaws fitting as tightly as their sea-going
outfits, and, as far as the captain himself,
he was no longer set up in landscape style. Straight
as a poker he stood on the newly discovered bridge
like an image of lead.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t jar me if Herr Roque showed up with
horns on his forehead instead of in spectacle trimming.”</p>

<p>Billy was preparing for the next fall of the wand.</p>

<p>While the boys were watching the hoist of the
anchor, following a curt command from the officer<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
on the bridge, and a distant chime was proclaiming
the midnight hour, Billy was made aware that someone,
not of the regular crew, was standing at his
elbow.</p>

<p>The voice was that of Herr Roque, but the
speaker could never for a single moment be materially
taken for the late elderly spectacled merchant.</p>

<p>“How now, young sirs; is it well with you?”</p>

<p>Billy and Henri stared at the face showing in
the pale gleam of a spar light. Clean-shaven, thin-lipped,
hard-eyed, not a trace of the benevolent cast
of countenance worn by the bland tradesman.</p>

<p>The line of talk was there, but not another line
of the other assumed character.</p>

<p>“Is&mdash;it&mdash;really&mdash;Herr Roque?” stammered Billy.</p>

<p>“At your service, young sirs.”</p>

<p>“It all works like a play,” put in Henri.</p>

<p>“I hope not a tragedy, young sirs.”</p>

<p>“Would you mind cutting out the ‘young sirs’?”</p>

<p>Billy was getting nettled at this mockery.</p>

<p>“No offense intended, I assure you.”</p>

<p>For reasons of his own, the secret agent had no
desire to blunt the edge of his selected tools in useless
manner.</p>

<p>Indeed, he kept the boys on velvet, so to speak,
for the first two days at sea.</p>

<p>Then his mood changed with lack of leisure moments.<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
He was constantly on the alert and abrupt
in word and action.</p>

<p>There was a sailor constantly in the crosstrees,
sweeping the watery expanse with powerful glasses.
The gunners were standing, watch about, in readiness
for any emergency.</p>

<p>As a completing touch to this deck setting a runway
had been rigged and the boys for the first time
realized the part they were expected to play. There
was a pair of monoplanes under cover, a waspish
pair, of exquisite make and finish.</p>

<p>“Get to them and get them in shape,” sternly ordered
Roque, “as if your lives depended on it&mdash;and”
(grimly) “I guess they do.”</p>

<p>In this assignment Billy and Henri took the star
rôles.</p>

<p>“Smoke ahead,” sang out the man up the mast.</p>

<p>“Whereaway?” demanded the captain.</p>

<p>“South by southeast,” floated back from the masthead.</p>

<p>“Get that?” The captain to the wheelman.</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir.”</p>

<p>“Hold her hard, then.”</p>

<p>Signal to the engine room: “Slow speed.”</p>

<p>Roque summoned the boys with imperious motion.</p>

<p>“Take the air; bring signal red, if English warship;
signal white, if French cruiser; and signal
black, if channel steamer. Get away!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[233]</span></p>

<p>Four sailors manned the runway&mdash;first Billy shot
the chute; then Henri, a moment later. A clean
leap, and off they went.</p>

<p>The steamer they left logged lazily, drifting,
waiting.</p>

<p>The aviators guided the flight toward the thin
spiral of smoke penciling a point on the horizon.
The air was as clear as a bell.</p>

<p>With no fixed notion of what purpose they were
serving, the aviators exulted only in the joy of air
conquest. The machines were keyed up like a
watch&mdash;that is, perfection&mdash;and could be directed
to a hairline.</p>

<p>The smoke spiral was rope-sized, then body-round,
then a column.</p>

<p>The aviators looked down for a fleeting moment
on one of the large channel steamers, somewhat
out of its course, and instantly whirled about, flying
like the homing pigeon, and exactly as the compass
set the lines.</p>

<p>Each monoplane trailed a black streamer.</p>

<p>The sailor at the masthead caught the color in
his glasses.</p>

<p>And drawing nearer the aviators, caught their signal
to descend.</p>

<p>It is a nice piece of work to drop an aëroplane
upon the deck of a wave-rocked ship, and in this
instance it was a nice piece of work nicely done.</p>

<p>There was a gleam of approbation in the cold<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
gray eyes of Roque, when the machines floated in
and nested without strain or creak upon the foredeck.</p>

<p>“I see that I sized you about right,” he said, and
it could be plainly inferred that he accepted the
exhibit largely as a vindication of his own judgment.</p>

<p>True for Roque, for it had been said that he
seldom erred in matters of this kind.</p>

<p>It was also evident that the color of the signal
streamer was the one to his liking, for, with a great
flurry of orders, the vessel, under full head of
steam, hastened its hunt for the big channel boat,
as located by the aviators.</p>

<p>As they ran in course, the channel steamer was
crossing the line followed by the fast-approaching
German vessel. The latter, moving free, could easily
overhaul the cargo-laden ship, straightway, and
more surely in crossway.</p>

<p>The overhauling was soon accomplished, and the
unarmed channel boat hove to, to the tune of a
round shot across her bow.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri were not included in the boarding
party. They had served their turn, and beyond
that were not expected to serve.</p>

<p>They could not imagine what Roque had in mind
when all hands were hustling in the transfer of numerous
canvas rolls to the German deck, all labeled
“music machines.” They well knew of the Teuton<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
fondness for music, but here was a whole lot of
trouble and expense to get what might have been
easily and cheaply purchased in Hamburg.</p>

<p>Roque made no attempt to take prisoners or other
plunder from the nonresisting commercial carrier.</p>

<p>The “music machines” were all he wanted, and,
with a deck full of them, the German vessel broke
its grapples and steamed away.</p>

<p>It never dawned upon the boys that the labels
were not the true index of contents, until one of
the parcels was broken open for inspection.</p>

<p>The wrappings enclosed rifles&mdash;hundreds of
them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XLVI" class="no-break">CHAPTER XLVI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE FACE IN THE MIRROR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“This man Roque must have a long reach to
have known about that consignment of guns, how
and when they were to be shipped, and make the
strike he did within three days.”</p>

<p>Billy was discussing with Henri some of the
remarkable features of the recent voyage, as the
steamer came in sight of Helgoland Bay, on the
return trip.</p>

<p>“He’s a magician, that’s what he is,” maintained
Billy. “Did you ever see the beat of the way he
unmasked this ship?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[236]</span></p>

<p>“And himself,” added Henri.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the Elbe, the tarpaulins again
shrouded the warlike fixings that had been revealed
by their removal, and it was the familiar “trading
vessel,” dandy captain, roustabouts, and all, that
went in with the tide.</p>

<p>“Home again, young sirs.”</p>

<p>The oily tradesman once more, horn spectacles,
bland address, and benevolent smile&mdash;Herr Roque,
the peaceful merchant with a liking for bright
young men and pleasure trips when business was
dull.</p>

<p>“We’ll have a little run up to Kiel by the way of
the great canal, a nice jaunt to complete our vacation,
young sirs.”</p>

<p>Herr Roque was the picture of innocence, as he
genially waved his hand to a party of harbor officials,
passing near in a launch. He took snuff from
a silver box and extended the compliment of giving
the captain a chance to take a pinch.</p>

<p>It was noticeable, however, that the slightest
word from the kind “merchant” commanded the
instant respect and attention of those about him.</p>

<p>“It would make us all very happy, my dear captain,
if you could spare the time to arrange our
ship to Kiel. Herr Raum is very anxious to get
the goods. He has orders from Berlin to fill.”</p>

<p>This comedy was for the sole benefit of the assemblage
on the docks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[237]</span></p>

<p>The canvas rolls with the rifles inside were already
on the way to Kiel, and the boxes to which
Roque was pointing were simply ship supplies.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri were not aware that they had
been accorded an unusual privilege when they
looked upon the real Roque during the hunt for
the channel steamer.</p>

<p>Kiel, in contrast to Hamburg, seethed with activity,
the streets swarming with sailors and marines,
while in the harbor dispatch boats dashed
hither and thither.</p>

<p>Herr Roque kept Billy and Henri close to his
elbow, and forbade their engaging in conversation
with any stranger, unless duly presented by him.
The English tongue was not at all popular in Kiel
at this time. Henri, to be sure, could rattle off
German like a native, but it was deemed best that
he also become a mute like his companion.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this precaution, the boys were
fated to have their usual adventure before quitting
this lively town. They never would stand hitched!
Herr Roque had some special business in the town,
no doubt concerning the “music boxes,” and he
“planted” his young charges in a hotel near the
docks, with a word to the landlord to give them
a look over now and then.</p>

<p>“I don’t propose to stick around this coffee house
all day,” rebelled Billy, “when there is so much going<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
on outside. Let’s join that crowd piking at the
harbor. Something’s doing there.”</p>

<p>Henri was in the same humor, and the pair mixed
with the mentioned curious crowd.</p>

<p>The attraction was three huge liners transformed
by a coat of gray paint and yellow funnels.</p>

<p>The boys pushed their way to the front rank of
the viewers, and then a little ahead of what appeared
to be the limit of approach.</p>

<p>There was a murmur from the crowd. It was
known that soldiers aboard were not allowed to
leave these particular ships, popularly believed to
be transports destined for the invasion of England,
and an equally stern rule that nobody was allowed
to come near them.</p>

<p>Of course, Billy and Henri had no knowledge of
the rule, and they crossed the deadline as care-free
as clams.</p>

<p>Then something dropped. It was a heavy hand
on the shoulder of Henri, a few feet in advance of
his chum. Somebody set a vise-like grip on Billy’s
wrist. A bevy of graybacks fluttered around them.
They had committed the unpardonable sin of ignoring
a military order, and also they were unpardonably
foreign to the soil. They were English,
until they proved themselves something else.</p>

<p>A lane opened in the muttering crowd, and
through it marched the file of soldiers, with the<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
suspects sandwiched between the leader and the
next in line.</p>

<p>At the city hall the soldiers and the suspects abruptly
deserted the lengthy street procession behind
them, and the prisoners were presented without
further ceremony to the bulky occupant of a revolving
chair within a railed enclosure.</p>

<p>“What have we here?” sharply questioned the
man behind the railing.</p>

<p>The soldier spokesman briefly related the cause
of the arrest.</p>

<p>“Lock them up.” This order completed the first
hearing.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri a few minutes later perched
themselves on a sack mattress filled with straw, in
a prison cell.</p>

<p>“‘In the prison cell I sit,’” chanted Billy.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a chump,” complained Henri. “This
is a serious matter, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use of crying, old top, when you
can sing?”</p>

<p>Billy was prescribing a tonic for his partner.</p>

<p>“There is just one man who can get us out of
this scrape,” stated Henri, “and he wears horn
spectacles.”</p>

<p>“It won’t take that man long to find us; he’s a
smooth one.”</p>

<p>Billy had the utmost confidence in Herr Roque’s<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
ability as a sleuth since the affair of the “music
boxes.”</p>

<p>Footfalls sounded in the long corridor outside.</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s him now,” was Henri’s eager
expression, as he hastened to the grated door of
the cell.</p>

<p>But the footfalls did not belong to Roque. The
man at the door was only a burly guard who handed
in two tins of hot coffee and a dangling roll of
raw sausages.</p>

<p>“Say, major,” pleaded Henri in German, “we’ve
got a good friend uptown that knows all about
us&mdash;can’t we get word to him?”</p>

<p>Even the rank of “major” did not appeal to the
jailer, for he only grunted, and turned on his heel.</p>

<p>“Looks like a night of it, Henri.”</p>

<p>“And there will be a morning of it, too,” predicted
Henri.</p>

<p>“‘We won’t go home until morning,’” warbled
Billy.</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the use? You have quit being human.”</p>

<p>Failing to turn his friend from his waggish way,
Henri rolled over on the straw mattress and went
to sleep. Billy followed suit.</p>

<p>They were awakened by the clang of a bolt, and
sprang to sitting position, rubbing their eyes.</p>

<p>The jailer, with a lantern swung to his arm like
a railway conductor, was framed in the cell door.<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
A pair of horn spectacles glistened over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Glory be! It’s Herr Roque!”</p>

<p>Billy was not bluffing now. He was glad enough
to see this able protector.</p>

<p>Herr Roque did not appear to be very amiable.
He was not accustomed to have his arrangements
disturbed by a pair of flyaways like these. But he
was still the finished actor, for the guard’s benefit,
and pretended, in words, to be overwhelmed with
anxiety:</p>

<p>“How glad I am to see you, my young friends.
I could not imagine what had become of you, and
I had been seeking you high and low when I met
the Burgomaster Haupt coming from his club,
and he told me about the trouble at the docks. I
was shocked, indeed, and it has been proved all a
mistake.”</p>

<p>When he got the boys outside, though, he concluded
a different line of talk with:</p>

<p>“I’ll have to tie bells around your necks when
next you wander in strange pastures. You are likely
to get into a neck-twisting fix with such pranks
as these.”</p>

<p>Neither Billy nor Henri made speeches for the
defense. They meekly accepted this chiding, all
the time rejoicing that they were again breathing
free air. It was a mile ahead of six-by-eight stone
walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[242]</span></p>

<p>“I’m through here,” briefly announced Herr
Roque at breakfast, “and after a call at Bremen
I am going to restore this pair of lambs to the aviation
lieutenant at Hamburg. There you can always
be found when I want you.”</p>

<p>“That means, Herr Roque, I suppose, that we
will get cards for some more vacation trips?”</p>

<p>“It means, young man, that if you ask no questions
you will receive no false information.”</p>

<p>Billy was subdued for once.</p>

<p>At Bremen they found the hotels deserted, but
the theaters and cafés full.</p>

<p>It was among these cafés that the boys sharpened
their wits by close observation of Herr Roque, who
was always looking for something when he appeared
to be looking for nothing but an easy way
of life.</p>

<p>They found occasion to use keen wit before that
first evening in Bremen was over. It was a startling
test.</p>

<p>As they basked in the benevolence of Herr Roque,
facing him at a well-spread table in one of the brilliantly
lighted cafés, Billy saw a familiar face reflected
in a mirror hanging on the wall back of the
chair occupied by their host&mdash;the smiling face of
the secretary the boys had met in the office of the
great man in Calais, who speeded them on their
way to Paris.</p>

<p>The mirror also reflected the garb of a sailor,<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>
merchant marine, and the man was at a table directly
back of where the aviators were seated.</p>

<p>Billy felt in a flash that it would be like signing
a friend’s death warrant to make the least show
of recognition.</p>

<p>Fearful that Henri might forget himself and
draw the attention of Herr Roque, if suddenly confronted
with the mirrored face, Billy used a knowledge
of telegraphy, in which his companion was
expert, by softly finger-tapping on the polished table
surface between them the word “caution.”</p>

<p>Henri was puzzled at the operation, but with the
warning gave no sign by change of expression.</p>

<p>Herr Roque was toying with a fork, and seemed
to be thinking at a distance. The boys, for the
time being, were forgotten pawns.</p>

<p>Billy tapped “mirror.”</p>

<p>Henri fixed a glance there.</p>

<p>Three pairs of eyes met in the shining glass.</p>

<p>The smile left the face reflected from behind.</p>

<p>The “sailor” knew and was known. His right
hand was lifted carelessly to his lips, and a finger
lingered there for a scant second.</p>

<p>The understanding was complete.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XLVII" class="no-break">CHAPTER XLVII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE MYSTERIOUS MESSAGE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The boys were just aching in spirit for even a
word with the supposed sailor, safely out of range
of the lynx-eyed Roque, but the latter, after the experience
in Kiel, stuck closer than a burr to his
charges.</p>

<p>The face had passed from the mirror, and the
owner of the smiling countenance sauntered
through the street door of the café, mingling with
many of his kind, smoking and chatting on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“How will we make it?” tapped Billy on the
table.</p>

<p>“Do not know,” was Henri’s answering tap.</p>

<p>Roque had paid the waiter for the dinner service,
and was placidly puffing a long, black cigar.</p>

<p>“We might take a stroll,” suggested Billy.</p>

<p>“Something like you did at Kiel?”</p>

<p>The secret agent seemed to have amused himself
with this sly dig, but it was lost upon his young
companions, who were working their wits to invent
a getaway.</p>

<p>“How would you like to go to the theater?”</p>

<p>“Bully idea!” This was Billy’s vote.</p>

<p>“Fine!” echoed Henri.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[245]</span></p>

<p>As the three passed out of the café, the boys
brushed against the very man with whom they
were eager to speak.</p>

<p>Billy was inspired at the moment to distinctly
address Herr Roque regarding their return journey
to the air camp:</p>

<p>“What time to-morrow do we leave for Hamburg,
sir?”</p>

<p>Roque gave Billy a look of stern rebuke.</p>

<p>Billy was not worried about the answer he did
not get in words. He saw a certain bystander uncover
a fine set of teeth, and that was enough.</p>

<p>The play at the theater was a war drama, which
was not at all like the real thing, but Billy was so
delighted with the success of his stratagem at the
café door that he was inclined to applaud at both
the right and the wrong time.</p>

<p>Henri held his praise for his chum, when the two
retired for the night.</p>

<p>“It looks like a case of ‘diamond cut diamond’
to me,” he observed, “for you can wager that they
would never send a fool over here to buck against
the like of Roque.”</p>

<p>“I bet they wouldn’t,” was Billy’s sleepy opinion.</p>

<p>The next evening the boys were back in the air
camp at Hamburg.</p>

<p>“You have your hands full, lieutenant,” remarked
Roque, with a wink and a nod at our
Aviator Boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[246]</span></p>

<p>There is no telling what he might have said had
he known what Billy had put over on him the night
before.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the lieutenant, “though it appears
that Roque has the first call on you, I’m going to
keep you busy between times, and as there is nobody
around now to scuttle your air mounts you
can fly to your hearts’ content.”</p>

<p>They flew the air as they willed, in monoplanes
and biplanes, singly or doubly, and, as usual, at
the same time these boys managed to fly together
into some of the ticklish affairs of earth.</p>

<p>It was on a Sunday morning that a jolly party
of sailors came over from the harbor to the air
camp, and, as they were all supposed to be “true
blue,” or, rather, “true gray,” they were permitted
to poke their noses into the hangars without restraint.</p>

<p>Billy and Henri, as the chief aviators present,
were counted in as part of the exhibit, and delegated
to represent the lieutenant, who claimed this
one day for late slumber.</p>

<p>One of the sailors, while he and his comrades
were watching the aërial maneuvers of a Zeppelin,
had picked standing room as near to our
Aviator Boys as he could conveniently get. So enthusiastic
was this man over the majestic flight of
the big airship that he grasped the hand of the nearest<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
member of the flying profession, which proved
to be Henri.</p>

<p>There was something more than the mere pressure
of the shake, however, for Henri’s fingers
closed over a wad of paper.</p>

<p>The sailor kept on cheering, but he did not keep
on standing in the same spot.</p>

<p>The paper wad lay in an itching palm, for the
holder was itching to open it.</p>

<p>He knew the man who had “delivered the mail!”</p>

<p>Billy also had something of an acquaintance with
the bubbling sailor.</p>

<p>When the boys jointly read the faint tracing of

Kiel harbor, but their further adventures in their
chosen profession will be found in the second book
of this series under the title of “<span class="smcap">Our Young Aëroplane
